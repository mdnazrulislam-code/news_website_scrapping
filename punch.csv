The party also assured its supporters that there are greater opportunities in the future for the party.
The party stated this in a statement released on Saturday signed by its Publicity Secretary, Hakeem Amode.
This call is coming after the verdict of the Supreme Court which affirmed the re-election of the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Friday.     
Following the announcement of Sanwo-Olu as the winner of the 2023 governorship election in the state, the PDP governorship candidate, Abdulazeez Adediran, popularly known as Jandor, filed a petition before the state governorship election tribunal where he called for the disqualification of the candidates of the All Progressives Congress and the Labour Party, Sanwo-Olu and Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour for “non-compliance” with the Electoral Act 2022 and the guidelines of the Independent National Electoral Commission.
In the petition marked EPT/LAG/GOV/01/2023 dated April 7, the PDP and Jandor noted that APC failed to comply with the INEC timetable.
However, the Tribunal affirmed the re-election of Sanwo-Olu and dismissed his petition.      
But dissatisfied with the verdict, Jandor filed an appeal challenging the judgment of the state Election Petitions Tribunal.
He filed the appeal together with his party, PDP before the state’s Court of Appeal and contended that the name Sanwo-Olu submitted to INEC was different from that contained in his WAEC certificate.
The Court of Appeal dismissed the case and affirmed Sanwo-Olu’s election victory.
He alongside his party, the PDP proceeded to the Supreme Court to appeal the judgement of the Court of Appeal.
However, the apex court dismissed the appeal, describing it as “academic”.
Reacting to the judgment, the party said it is concluding matters related to the election and called on its members and supporters to not lose faith in the party.
The statement read, “We Are Not Discouraged By Supreme Court Judgment” “Following the Supreme Court’s verdict on the 2023 Governorship Election in Lagos State, which our party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), contested, we are officially concluding all matters related to the election.          Related News  Legal triumph: Supreme Court affirms election victories of 10 governors  It will be difficult to dislodge APC in 2027, declares PDP  Supreme court verdict: Otti commends Tinubu for being neutral   
“In light of this, we appeal to the residents of the state and our numerous supporters to maintain optimism, as we firmly believe that there will always be another opportunity.
“As a party committed to democratic principles, the PDP has no option but to move forward after the highest court has issued a conclusive judgment on the matter.
“Our candidate in the election, Dr. Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran aka Jandor, has shared his perspective on the judgment and has even extended congratulations to Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, whose victory has been affirmed by the court.
“We remain dedicated to fostering a thriving democracy, and we will refrain from any actions that undermine the hard-fought gains achieved during the military era.
“The Lagos State chapter of the PDP believes that if given the opportunity to serve the people, we have more comprehensive programmes for the residents compared to the current offerings.
“We firmly hold that Lagos State residents should not endure hardship amidst abundance, and we are confident that another chance to serve will emerge in the near future. We will not allow this momentary setback to dampen our spirits.
“Lagos, as a metropolitan state and the commercial center of Nigeria, holds a prominent position nationally and competes with some African countries in terms of GDP, population, and developmental indicators.”      
The party, however, disclosed that despite losing the election, its candidate will always be available for public services.
“Our candidate, Jandor, remains committed to public service and will continue to make himself available whenever the need arises.
“There will always be another opportunity, and we will not let this temporary setback hinder our pursuit of making Lagos State an egalitarian society with equal opportunities for everyone.
“We also want to express our gratitude to everyone who supported us before, during, and after the election. We thank all PDP members in Lagos State, our supporters, market men and women, business people, traders, journalists, traditional rulers, religious leaders, and many others for their unwavering support.
“Your dedication during the campaigns, at the polls, and throughout the legal proceedings has not gone unnoticed. You have shown us that you are dependable, and we are not alone in our quest for the kind of society we deserve in the state.
“May we also use this opportunity to urge you all to vote for the candidate of the PDP in the forthcoming election into the Surulere Federal Constituency 1 in the House of Representatives to fill the seat left by the former speaker of the House, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/20173733/Lagos4Lagos-Jandor.jpg

Akande, who spoke to journalists in his Ila-Orangun country home on Saturday as part of activities marking his 85th birthday, said until Nigerians have a change of mindset and embrace the virtues of dedication and hard work, no leader would be able to attack and defeat corruption in the country.
The pioneer Interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, who lamented that rather than embracing hard work, many Nigerians would prefer to cut corners, said leadership alone could not make people prosperous.
He further said, “In Nigeria, corruption is not the first thing to fight otherwise you get perished. The mindset is corrupt.

The National Information Technology Development Agency under the purview of the Ministry of Communications, Innovations and Digital Economy announced this via a press release on Saturday in Abuja.
The Head of Corporate Affairs and External Relations of NITDA, Hadiza Umar, said the review was designed to streamline the process, uphold the highest standards of professionalism in IT services, and nourish the growth of local IT companies.
The government had, in 2018, outlined a registration process for indigenous IT companies to nourish their growth in adherence to a presidential executive order but was inefficiently implemented.     
A copy of the guidelines showed that only indigenous applicants will be considered for registration and must have at least one of its principal officers registered with the Computer Professionals of Nigeria.
As a result of the inefficiency, the NITDA spokesperson stated that a review of the guidelines will be carried out under global trends to ensure competent vendors are engaged for IT service delivery.

She added that the guidelines will create opportunities for more digital services to be provided by Nigerian companies while strengthening the ease of doing business for IT service providers.      
Umar said, “The National Information Technology Development Agency is undertaking a comprehensive review of the guidelines for registration of ICT service providers/contractors, designed to streamline the process for the delivery of IT services to Ministries, Departments, and Agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria.
“Since the issuance of the guidelines, the agency has identified the need to improve the efficiency in the process of registration, promote indigenous IT service provision, ensure competent vendors are engaged for IT service delivery to Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria.”
She noted that “NITDA desires to collaborate with all stakeholders to ensure that Nigerians benefit from the use of Information Technology to enhance and simplify their daily activities, especially service delivery by government and other institutions. This aligns with the present administration’s drive to ensure collective prosperity through efficiency and innovation.
“The review, which will result in the amendment of the guidelines, will create opportunities for more digital services to be provided by Nigerian companies while strengthening the ease of doing business for IT serviceproviders.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/10231935/Mrs.-Hadiza-Umar.jpg

The panel will be led by the Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance, Mr. Wale Edun.
The SPP comes 24 hours after Tinubu suspended all administered Social Investment Programmes by the National Social Investment Programme Agency which also includes the school-feeding programme.
A statement signed on Friday by the Director of Information, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Segun Imohiosen, said the suspension was in view of the “ongoing investigation of alleged malfeasance in the management of the agency and its programmes.”     
Sequel to the six-week suspension of the four programmes, Tinubu tasked the Edun-led panel to “immediately undertake a comprehensive review and audit of existing financial frameworks and policy guidelines of the social investment programmes.”

The SPP, which is comprised of ministers representing strategic sectors and will ensure a multi-disciplinary approach to the reform effort, is made up of the coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance as Chairman, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Prof Ali Pate as Member.
Other members are the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Abubakar Bagudu, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Muhammad Idris; Minister of Communicatons, Innovation and Digital Economy, Bosun Tijjani; and the Minister of State for Youth, Ayodele Olawande.
Tinubu anticipates that the anel will “validate the confidence reposed in it by winning back all lost public confidence in these vital programmes over the years by ushering in a new era of operation based on open and accountable governance frameworks.”
He said these frameworks will prove “impervious to abuse and incompetence for the exclusive benefit of disadvantaged households across our nation.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/11183908/Tinubu-signs.jpeg

The move, according to an officia...",13th January 2024,https://punchng.com/cbn-decongests-head-office-moves-departments-to-lagos/,Daniel Adaji,"The Central Bank of Nigeria is set to transfer some of its departments to Lagos State.
This was stated in an Internal memo made available to PUNCH Online on Saturday.
The move, according to an official of the CBN who spoke on condition of anonymity, is to decongest the apex bank’s head office.
Although some staff members of the bank have reportedly resisted the transfer and claimed that it is motivated by tribal sentiment, the source said it is for their safety and increased productivity.     
“What is happening now at the CBN is likened to a company with over 500 staff and say 200 used to go to work in other states and return to the head office. It is not out of place for the company to relocate them fully to that state to work and increase their safety and productivity,” he said.
The official stated that only some departments of the apex bank, including the Bank Supervision Department, were affected by the transfer.
He stated that the move is meant to increase the productivity of the affected staff while also cutting costs and ensuring their safety.      
PUNCH Online gathered through the official that the departments penciled down for relocation by the CBN Governor, Yemi Cardoso are Banking Supervision; Other Financial Institutions Supervision; Consumer Protection Department; Payment System Management Department and Financial Policy Regulations Department.
” Most of the bank’s headquarters are in Lagos. The CBN usually sends staff from Abuja to work in Lagos for like one to two months and return to the head office.
“Being on the road all the time is not safe for them and not also cost-efficient for the bank. We know that anybody leaving their comfort would feel the pain, that is why some of the affected workers are complaining but I can assure you that, it is for their good,” he said.
He also noted that the carrying capacity of the Abuja office is 3 000 but the staff strength is at 4 000 now which is a threat to the facilities at the head office.  Related News  Keystone Bank allays customers' fear, promises smooth operations  Union, Polaris, Keystone: CBN plans shareholders summit, compiles new directors’ lists  No CBN official arrested, says DSS   
“Abuja office is designed to carry about 3 000 staff but we are 4 000 already. The facility managers have already warned of the implication; the security of staff is also at stake with the increased number because it overwhelms the managers,” the official stated.
Excerpts from the memo obtained read, “This is to notify all staff members at the CBN Head Office that we have initiated a decongestion action plan designed to optimise the operational environment of the bank.
“This initiative aims to ensure compliance with building safety standards and enhance the efficient utilisation of our office space.        
“This action is necessitated by several factors, including the need to align the Bank’s structure with its functions and objectives, redistribute skills to ensure a more even geographical spread of talent and comply with building regulations, as indicated by repeated warnings from the Facility Manager, and the findings and recommendations of the Committee on Decongestion of the CBN Head Office.
“The action plan focuses on optimising the utilisation of other Bank’s premises. With this plan, 1,533 staff will be moved to other CBN facilities within Abuja, Lagos and understaffed branches.
“Our current occupancy level of 4,233 significantly exceeds the optimal capacity of 2,700 designed for the Head Office building. This overcrowding poses several critical challenges:
“Safety Concerns: The building’s infrastructure was designed for a specific number of occupants. Exceeding this capacity has raised safety concerns, increased health and accident risks – and hinders efficient emergency evacuation.
“Reduced Efficiency: Crowded workspaces are negatively impacting productivity and collaboration. Additionally, overstretched facilities have led to increased maintenance costs.
“Structural Integrity: The building’s integrity can be compromised by exceeding its designed capacity.”
The memo further said the decongestion would also improve the apex bank’s operational and workflow efficiency.      
“Strategic alignment: The decision to redistribute departments and staff is rooted in a strategic approach to align the structure of the Bank with its functions and objectives. Certain departments may be better suited to operate in proximity to Financial Institutions’ head offices, which are predominantly located in Lagos. This strategic alignment ensures optimal collaboration and efficiency,” thememostated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/28080107/cbn.jpg

The minister gave the assurance in a statement signed by the ministry’s spokesperson, Stephen Kilebe, on Saturday.
The Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Road forms a critical part of Nigeria’s highway which runs from north to south, enabling the movement of people and products across the country, thereby, uniting Nigerians and the economy.
It also connects Nigeria to North Africa via the Lagos-Algiers Trans-African Highway.     
To address the poor condition and deterioration of this major road, the Federal Government contracted the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the 375.9km of the dual carriageway to Julius Berger: from the Federal Capital Territory Abuja through Kaduna, excluding the Kaduna bypass, to Zaria and further north to Kano.
However, Edun noted that the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano dual carriageway is a viable project, adding that he does not doubt the completion of the project on time by the contractors.
The statement read, “The Minister of Finance and Co-Ordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, and his Federal Ministry of Works counterpart, Senator David Umahi, have embarked on the inspection of the Abuja – Kaduna – Zaria – Kano Dual Carriage Way.      
“In his remarks, the minister said they were at the inspection of the project today under the mandate of President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda to examine and hear from the contractors and see their commitment, encourage and support them to the early completion of this all-important project and to urge them to do more.”  Related News  FG releases N17bn for Abuja-Kano highway  Using asphalt for road construction not banned, says FG  JUST IN: FG orders installation of CCTV on nine highways   
Edun reiterated that infrastructure was a critical priority of the Tinubu-led administration “in order to get food prices down, ease transportation of agricultural produce, movement of people freely across the country, and stabilise the economy.”
The minister assured the contractors of the availability of funds for the early completion of the road project.
He said, “We have come, we have seen the level of commitment of the contractors to the completion of the project as soon as possible.”
The minister, who commended the level of progress made on the project, said the ongoing attempt was to improve domestic resources mobilisation available to highly viable projects such as this.
Earlier, Umahi disclosed that Tinubu had directed that they “must ensure that work is completed on this project in 24 months.”
He added that “the two ministers are sorting out the payment modalities and ensuring milestone completion of the project.”        
Umahi also thanked him for making critical decisions about the completion of the projects.

Speaking earlier, the Indian High Commissioner in Nigeria, Shri Balasubramanian, appreciated the contributions of the scheme to the development of Nigeria and revealed that its selection for participation in the Youth Exchange Programme along with other countries, was informed by its uniqueness as well as similarities with the National Cadet Corps of India.
While promising the corps members memorable and impactful experiences during the programme, the High Commissioner said India would be willing to learn from the scheme’s experiences.
He further expressed the pleasure of the Indian government with the last set of corps members who attended the country’s 75th Independence anniversary and urged the present set to emulate their predecessors, as all expenses for the trip would be catered for by the Indian Government.

The communique was co-signed by the chairman of the NUT in the FCT, Abdullahi Shafas, the Secretary, Mrs Margaret Jethro and the Publicity Secretary, Ibukun Adekeye.
The SWSC also urged secondary school teachers to join the strike from January 22, if the demands of the primary school teachers were not met before January 19, 2024.     
The union had embarked on indefinite strike action on September 11, 2023, to demand the implementation of a 40% peculiar allowance, and payment of 25 months minimum age arrears, among other arrears.

Following Okanlomo’s ...,13th January 2024,https://punchng.com/just-in-rtean-names-okanlomo-lagos-chairman-dissolves-executive-council/,Abiodun Sanusi,"The Road Transport Employers’ Association of Nigeria has announced the appointment of Adesina Hussaini aka Okanlomo as the chairman of the association in Lagos State.
Following Okanlomo’s appointment, the union also announced the dissolution of the earlier inaugurated 35-member Lagos State RTEAN executive council.
The RTEAN National President, Musa Muhammed, made the development known in a statement made available to journalists on Saturday.
Muhammed said, “In reference to the resolution reached by the Federal Executive Council and organised Labour in reconciling our matter with the Lagos State Government and the national executive of our great association, the RTEAN, we announce the dissolution of our former structure of Lagos State executives council members, and adopt the appointment of Adeshina Hussaini (Okanlomo) as the chairman of the Lagos State branch of the RTEAN.     
“All those members who were suspended in the course of the matter are hereby recalled for the interest of peace and harmony in the state. We call on all members to be law-abiding and constitutionally guided.”
In another statement signed by the RTEAN General Secretary, Yusuf Adeniyi, the union noted that the move complied with the provision of item 6 of the Memorandum of Understanding dated October 2, 2023, between the Federal Government of Nigeria and organised labour, to bolster industrial harmony and ensure strict adherence to the rule of law.
Adeniyi said, “The contentious issue of RTEAN leadership has been laid to rest with the unanimous appointment of a new state chairman. Adesina Hussaini a.k.a Okanlomo is the new chairman of the RTEAN in Lagos State effective from January 1, 2024.      
“The Lagos State RTEAN and all property hitherto taken away will hereby be returned to the union. The operation of the RTEAN in all motor parks in Lagos State is to resume with immediate effect. No member of the RTEAN will be victimised by the union or the Lagos State Government for their role in the dispute.
“We are therefore calling on all our members to comply with the peaceful resolution reached and cooperate with the government and security agencies in discharging their duties. We thank all those who contributed in one way or the other, for seeing this matter get resolved amicably.”
The Federal Government resolved the 15-month-long dispute between the RTEAN and the Lagos State Government.
In a letter dated January 6, 2024, and addressed to the Trade Union Congress, the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, revealed that the ban initially slammed on the union’s operations in Lagos State had been lifted following a peace move brokered during a meeting with the leadership of the organised labour.
The resolution laid to rest the contentious issue of RTEAN leadership with the unanimous appointment of a new leadership for the union in the state.

For 15 months, the activities of the RTEAN were banned in Lagos state following a leadership crisis that engulfed the association.
This led the state government to slam a ban on the association and subsequently appointed a 35-man Caretaker Committee to take over the activities of the union.        
However, the intervention of the Office of the NSA has now brought an amicable resolution of all issues that were initially in dispute.
In the letter signed by the NSA and addressed to the Secretary-General of the TUC, it was revealed that Adeshina Teslim (aka Okanlomo), has been appointed as the new Chairman of the RTEAN in Lagos State with effect from January 1, 2024.
According to Ribadu, the Lagos State office of the RTEAN and all properties hitherto taken away will returned to the union.
He added that the operation of the RTEAN in all motor parks in Lagos State is to resume with immediate effect.
“No member of RTEAN will be victimised by the union or Lagos State Government for their role in the dispute. Lagos State Government, its agencies, and the general public are to be intimated about the peaceful resolution.
“On this premise, you are humbly requested to intimate the union on the amicable resolution of the dispute and the highlights of the agreements reached,” the NSA stated in the letter.
Ribadu noted that the action complied with the provisions of Item 6 of the Memorandum of Understanding dated October 2, 2023, between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Organised Labour to intervene in the crisis to facilitate peaceful resolution of the issues.      
The intervention of the Federal Government, he said, was also in line with the commitment of the present administration to bolster industrial harmony and ensure strict adherence to theruleoflaw.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/13131602/Okanlomo.jpg

In a message he posted on X (formerly Twitter), Onanuga said Tinubu, at a meeting in Abuja on Friday with governors of the All Progressives Congress, revealed his plans to rejig Nigeria’s security architecture.
Onanuga wrote, “He (Tinubu) mentioned three brand new police formations, to augment the regular police.
“He said the deployment of forest guards was being considered, with better training, modern technological gadgets and weapons to strengthen security.     
“He said the solid mineral and marine economic sectors will also be secured by special police.”
The presidential aide further quoted Tinubu as saying, “We have a big marine economy, and I do not see why we should not have the marine police.
“We will have the same in solid minerals to keep the scavengers away. I am ready to invest in security.”      
Despite Tinubu’s promise to establish marine police, however, PUNCH Online reports that marine police currently exist as an arm of the Nigeria Police Force.
According to information available on the website of the NPF, the marine police was established in 1891 in Lagos, and was then styled ‘Night Water Patrol.’
“The Marine Section is currently a branch of the ‘B’ Department of the Force. The Section has 81 Marine Stations, and Outpost spread across the length and breadth of the inland navigable rivers and waterways in the country.

Onanuga also quoted Tinubu as revealing his plans to stock the nation’s mineral resources, in reserve.
“We will buy our own minerals and keep them in reserves, especially gold, which will be effective in our foreign exchange reserve,’’ the President reportedly told the governors.
The President had earlier set up a constitutional review committee to carry out comprehensive police reforms.        
The Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, announced the development while speaking to State House correspondents at the end of a meeting of the Nigeria Police Council chaired by the President in late October 2023.
The council at the meeting confirmed Olukayode Egbetokun as the substantive Inspector-General of Police.
According to Mohammed, members of the committee include Ibrahim Geidam, Minister of Police Affairs; Nuhu Ribadu, National Security Adviser; Solomon Arase, Chairman of the Police Service Commission; and AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, governor of Kwara State and the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum.
“The President has formed a special committee to look at all the gaps in Nigeria’s 1999 constitution with a view to bring harmony and synergy, closing technology and manpower to the Nigerian Police Force.
“The committee comprises the minister of police affairs, NSA, chairman of PSC, and the chairman of the NGF. They will work together with a view to make sure that the Nigeria Police is reformed,” Mohammed said inOctober2023.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/27171619/Tinubuu.jpg

BBC, on Monday, released a documentary of alleged eyewitness accounts of rape, fake miracles, torture, and forced abortions allegedly committed by the late prophet.

The actress said TB Joshua miraculously healed her daughter of Asthma when they visited his church.     
She said, “I want to tell the world what the late Senior Prophet TB Joshua did for me and my daughter. Initially, I don’t believe in prophecy, I am not that kind of person because there are so many scammers out there.
“But when I went to church that fateful day, my daughter had Asthma, to God be the glory, he delivered her.
“Something came out of her mouth which I didn’t believe, and my junior sister experienced something similar. That was when I started going to TB Joshua’s church.      
“Apart from that, he was a nice man to me and my family. I just want people to know that for me, he is a nice man and a man of God.”

The governor stated this when he paid a courtesy visit to the Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Abubakar Kyari, in his office in Abuja.
He said, “Kebbi State is ready to complement the Federal Government’s Special Dry Season Programme under the Ministry of Agriculture by providing solar-powered boreholes and power tillers to the participating farmers across the state.
“The state has so far procured 6,000 of such.”     
A statement signed by the media aide to the governor, Ahmed Idris, and made available to newsmen on Saturday said the governor used the opportunity to invite the minister as the Special Guest to the launching of the Kaura Agricultural Development and Growth Agenda and the distribution of solar pumps and power tillers to farmers in Kebbi State.
While congratulating the minister for running the affairs of the ministry in tune with the “Renewed Hope Agenda” of the president, the governor expressed the willingness of the state to partner with the ministry in achieving national food security.
Responding, the minister, Senator Abubakar Kyari, recalled that within the past week, he had been privileged to host executives from four states.      
He said, “There is no doubt that the collective steps we are taking to boost food production, reduce food inflation, and more assuredly guarantee our national food security are matters of urgent engagement that require increased inter-governmental interactions.

“In November 2023, we have flagged off the Wheat Dry Season Farming across 15 states that are in the wheat-producing belt of the country.”
The minister noted that the flag-off was intended to ensure that Nigeria relies less on rain-fed agricultural production during the wet season and is key to all-year-round farming.
Kyari observed that, in addition to boosting the volumes of crops cultivated, taking advantage of both dry and wet season farming would increase job opportunities, reduce poverty, de-escalate food inflation, and enhance inclusivity.
“These are goals highlighted in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda. Kebbi is one of the states chosen for dry-season farming across irrigable farmlands.
“Despite some of the initial glitches, it is reassuring that your government took necessary critical steps, such as land preparation and facilitation of tubular irrigation, to enable the cultivation of wheat under the National Agricultural Growth Scheme Agro-Pocket (NAGS-AP) Project.
“We are also aware that your government has supported farmers with additional fertilisers and other inputs and provided funds for commodity associations towards boosting agricultural productivity in the state,” he noted.

In his maiden address, the new governor promised to continue from where his predecessor stopped and also vowed to carry along all the stakeholders in his new administration.     
Also, after the swearing-in, the governor was reported to have met with President Bola Tinubu in Lagos, but the later was said to have advised him to reorganise the All Progressives Congress in the state before choosing the deputy governor.

Ogunleye, known as @Ogunleyeruthsavage1 on TikTok, recently shared her distressing experience on the platform.

“He [froze] my account for one year. February last year till date, no salary.”
“Anytime he feels like he wants to embarrass me, he asks some soldiers to beat me. After beating me up, they will inject me. He will ask one Funke Ayeni, she is a female soldier, and he will ask her to set me up. She will set me up, inject me and they will go and throw me somewhere. At the end of the day, this Brig. Gen. IB Solebo and some of those senior colonel, they will come to that place, they will be videoing me,” she added.
Ogunleye appealed to Nigerians for support.
She acknowledged the potential consequences of her actions, anticipating a possible arrest.
According to her, her father has tried to intervene with Col. IB Abdulkareem to bring her some peace.        
She claimed the officer told her father to relay the message to her to “Obey the last command.”  Related News  Tinubu sets up panel to audit social investment programmes  Rivers crisis: I've fulfilled my part of peace deal - Wike  Join me in developing Kano, governor woos APC candidate

Meanwhile, the Nigerian Army has promised to investigate Ogunleye’s allegations.
The Director of Army Public Relations, Maj. Gen. Nwachukwu Onyema said the investigation was to ascertain the extent of her claims.
Onyema also slammed the female soldier, adding that she did not seek redress according to the laid-down procedure.
“The Nigerian Army has been inundated with audiovisuals making the rounds on social media of the unprofessional conduct of a female soldier in mufti who claimed to have been maltreated by some senior officers.
“It is instructive to state that, considering the gravity of the allegations, NA, as a disciplined force, will conduct a thorough investigation into the matter,” he said.      
“We assure the general public that the NA as an institution is committed to upholding the integrity and morals of its personnel and as such, appropriate actions will be taken based on the findings of the investigation.
“We urge the public to allow the investigative process to take its course and refrain from making hasty judgments. The NA remains dedicated to serving our nation with honour and integrity,” he added.
This is the latest in reports of maltreatment by soldiers of the Nigerian army.
Inibehe Effiong, a public interest and human rights lawyer, recently filed a petition to the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Taoreed Lagbaja.
Effiong requested that the Army personnel responsible for assaulting police officer ASP Edet Inyang be identified and held accountable for their actions.
According to him, Inyang was subjected to torture by a group of Army personnel near the Nigerian Army’s 63 Brigade in Asaba, Delta State.
The incident reportedly took place on December 9, 2023, at a store where the policeman had gone to buy personal items.  
Similarly, in November 2023, the Adamawa State Police Command headquarters in Yola was allegedly invaded by the Nigerian Army, killing an inspector of police identified as Jacob Daniel.

These were after the counsel for the party involved in the matter opted to withdraw their appeals.     
Eno said, “Yesterday by the special grace of the Almighty God, the Supreme Court affirmed our governorship, affirmed all of your labour, your campaigns, your belief, all of your votes and so this calls for a double celebration.

However, the refinery has yet to produce Petroleum Motor Spirit, otherwise known as petrol.
The Chief Branding and Communications Officer of Dangote Group, Anthony Chiejina, had late on Friday confirmed the commencement of operations to our correspondent.
In a statement in the early hours of Saturday, the Dangote Group clarified that it has “commenced production of diesel and aviation fuel.”     
The Chairman of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, “elatedly thanked President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his support and encouragement, towards the actualisation of this project.”
He was said to have also thanked the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority and Nigerians for their support and belief in what he called the historic project.
“We thank President Bola Tinubu for his support and for making our dream come true. This production, as witnessed today, would not have been possible without his visionary leadership and prompt attention to details.      
“This is a big day for Nigeria. We are delighted to have reached this significant milestone. This is an important achievement for our country as it demonstrates our ability to develop and deliver large capital projects. This is a game changer for our country,” Dangote was quoted as having said.

“The products from the Refinery will conform to Euro V specifications. The refinery design complies with the World Bank, US EPA, European emission norms, and DPR emission/effluent norms.”
It was earlier reported that the Dangote Petroleum Refinery was set to start producing Automotive Gas Oil, also known as diesel, and JetA1 or aviation fuel, in January 2024, while the production of petrol was being delayed by the supply of crude oil in instalments.
The Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemical Project, a subsidiary of Dangote Industries Limited, is a 650,000 barrels per day crude oil refinery located in Dangote Industries Free Zone, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria.

PDP 2023 Presidential candidate, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, had made a merger proposition, while hosting the National Executive Committee of the Inter-Party Advisory Council of Nigeria.
The former Vice President warned against the likelihood of Nigeria slipping into a one-party state.
He said, “We have all seen how the APC is increasingly turning Nigeria into a dictatorship of one party. If we don’t come together to challenge what the ruling party is trying to create, our democracy will suffer for it, and the consequences of it will affect the generations yet unborn.”

Abdullahi, who alleged that the APC had impoverished Nigerians, said that only a genuine coalition of opposition political parties could boot out the President Bola Tinubu-led APC administration.
He said, “We believe only merger or coming together of all opposition political parties will produce a better result. So there is a need for other political parties to understand that it will be difficult to defeat the All Progressives Congress without a merger.      
“So the other political parties must see the reason and identify with the PDP’s clamour for coalition. So, if they see this, then the better for Nigeria’s opposition and the people.
“But if other political parties want to go about it individually, they are not as strong as the PDP. It is very difficult for us to attain the objective of taking charge of the government and sacking this army of occupation that has decided to inflict maximum penury and anguish on Nigerians.”
The PDP Deputy National Youth Leader, Timothy Osadolor, also noted that opposition political parties would find it difficult to dislodge the ruling party without synergy with the people.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/14024454/APC-and-PDP-flags.jpg

The men were killed and dumped in a forest by a group of military personnel after their remains were discovered and identified by their relatives and some members of the community as those arrested by some soldiers.
According to a report from a national daily, not PUNCH, the decomposing bodies of the victims; namely Safiyanu Adamu, Abdulkadir Idris, Akilu Abdullahi, Ibrahim Abubakar, Magaji Umar, Said Saleh, Abdulaziz Yusuf, Ibrahim Sani, Musa Asabe, Nura Yusuf and Nuru Magaji were discovered earlier on Monday in a forest close to an area called “Crossing”.
Relatives of the victims and some members of the community had claimed that the victims were innocent and unlawfully murdered by the military personnel.     
Adamu Idris, who is the father of one of the victims, Safiyanu Adamu, had explained that his son was arrested by the soldiers while taking him to hospital after being involved in an accident.
Abubakar Muhammad, a relative of another victim, Akilu Abdullahi, said the Abdullahi went to the market when he was arrested by soldiers, adding that they (relatives) did not hear from them (soldiers) since his arrest until he was eventually found dead in the forest.
But the Nigerian Army has since denied involvement in the killing of the men, insisting that their soldiers don’t kill suspects in their custody.      
Commenting on the matter, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Norrison Quakers, said such extrajudicial killings should be investigated by the relevant authorities, stressing that the erring military personnel should be identified and made to face the wrath of the law if found culpable.

He stated that the consequences of the soldiers’ conduct and actions should be subjected to criminal trials and the law be allowed to take its course.
He said, “There are consequences for such conducts and actions of extrajudicial killings. Of course, it must be investigated and if those persons are found culpable, they should be made to face the wrath of the law because extrajudicial killing is nothing but murder and the law of murder is very clear.
“The consequence of that is to be subjected to criminal trial and the law will take its course if found culpable. It involves a penalty which is death by hanging. Certainly, it has to be investigated not necessarily by the military.
“The Nigerian Police have the responsibility of investigating crime particularly when it affects the lives of innocent Nigerians being cut short. If it is investigated and these men are found culpable, it will be subjected to the military authority for them to look into it and those soldiers can now be subjected to Court Martial because they cannot be tried in civil court.”
Also, another rights lawyer, Festus Ogun, condemned the killing of innocent civilians, quoting Section 23 of the Nigerian constitution which protects citizens’ right to life.
He further urged that the military authority should carefully investigate the allegation and prosecute the perpetrators.        
Another lawyer, Abdulkareem Ridwan, noted that the soldiers had no right to kill anybody without court order, calling for the probe of the military men involved in the killings.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14102551/Kaduna.jpg

Some lawmakers had during the Yuletide distributed trailer loads of rice to their constituents in their respective names.
Among the federal lawmakers was the Senate leader, Opeyemi Bamidele, who according to a statement by his media office, distributed 3,000 bags of rice to his constituents during Christmas.
Similarly, the lawmaker representing Ayedire/Iwo/Olaoluwa Federal constituency, Mudashiru Lukman, on December 29, 2023, distributed 1,500 bags of rice as palliative to his constituents.     
Also, the senator representing Abia North, Orji Kalu, distributed 5,000 bags of rice to his Igbere constituents in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, a gesture, he explained was initiated in 1986 as his philanthropic endeavour being funded by him.
Also, Senator Godiya Akwashiki distributed four trailer loads of rice worth millions of naira to his constituents in the spirit of Christmas.
In commemoration of Christmas and New Year celebrations, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan (Kogi Central), also distributed six trailers of rice, 20,000 notebooks, and 10,000 wrappers as well as distributed 5,000 branded bags to school children in Kogi Central.      
The Senator representing Kogi West, Sunday Karimi, was also reported to have distributed eight trailer loads of rice to his constituents.
Things, however, went awry for the lawmakers, when in a viral video during the festive season, Dekeri Anamero, who represents Etsako Federal Constituency of Edo State in the National Assembly, said he got six trailer loads of rice for distribution to his constituents from the Federal Government.
Anamero, who is also a governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress in the 2024 state governorship election, said the N100m worth of rice was supplied through the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
Anamero said, “President Bola Tinubu ordered the Ministry of Agriculture to allocate N100m worth of rice and other grains to each of the 360 House of Representatives members to share with their constituents in December.  Related News  Anambra senator empowers constituents with cash, others  Lawmakers budget fresh N30bn for N’Assembly renovation  President signs budget as N’Assembly raises lawmakers allocation to N344bn   
“For the 109 senators, the allocation was N200m worth of rice palliatives for each of them to share. Please, my people, did your honourable members or senators share Tinubu’s rice in your constituency this Christmas? Don’t mind if they branded it with their pictures,” he said.
Earlier, the Senate spokesperson, Yemi Adaramodu, said that the food items and money distributed for his constituents for the celebration of Christmas and New Year were personally funded by him and not an FG allocation.
Efforts to reach him for fresh comment proved abortive as he didn’t answer his call or reply to messages from our correspondent.        
Just like Adaramodu, many of the senators refused to respond to inquiries on the rice palliative from Saturday PUNCH.
However, Senator Okechukwu Ezea (Labour Party, Enugu North), also denied receiving any form of palliative from the Federal Government but noted that the items he gave his constituent were from his benevolence.
He said, “Given the enormity of hardship faced by my constituents, I, at a personal cost, have gone ahead to distribute bags of rice in the new year across the 102 wards of my district.”
Meanwhile, a member of the House of Representatives has taken a swipe at the lawmaker representing Etsako East/Etsako West/Etsako Central Constituency, Dekeri Anamero, over what he called his careless remarks on Federal Government’s palliatives meant for distribution to Nigerians to celebrate the 2023 Christmas.
Anamero’s disclosure was said to have pitted some lawmakers against their constituents, who saw their representatives as a bunch of selfish leaders.
Speaking with Saturday PUNCH in confidence, the lawmaker said, “The truth is that the programme is real. The coordinating ministry is the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. I am awaiting the call from the ministry but I heard some of our colleagues have got theirs.
He said, “I cannot speak for anybody but what our colleague from Edo did is wrong. He made a careless comment. There was no need for him to say that because with or without Federal Government intervention, some of us have been giving out bags of rice to our constituents during major celebrations.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/28001203/palliatives.jpg

He claimed that the lady’s kidnappers fired several gunshots before grabbing her away in their vehicle.

Idu said the criminal behaviour of some of the youths attracted police attention, but upon being approached by officers, some of the boys became unruly and this resulted in a mob action on the officers, leading to a skirmish.
He said, “Two persons with strange behaviours were spotted at Biogbolo and when the police attempted to apprehend them for questioning, it led to the suspects raising their voices and that triggered a mob action in an attempt to disarm the policemen.”
He also claimed that the irate crowd attacked a team of the state-owned Community Safety Corps and attempted to disarm them.

PUNCH Metro gathered from an eyewitness on Thursday that the 43-year-old inspector was on an official duty at about 11:55 p.m. on Tuesday when the said driver rammed him down along the corridor of the expressway, leaving him with a serious head injury.
An eyewitness who did not want to be mentioned because of the sensitivity of the accident told our correspondent that the deceased victim was on a routine patrol along with his other colleagues when they discovered there was traffic congestion in the corridor.
While making efforts to ease the traffic congestion on the corridor, a driver was said to have hurriedly run off his line and knocked the officer to the ground.

She said, “Policemen are human. And they also have family members. Did no one see the driver knock down a police officer who was on duty and who was helping to ease traffic? Social media is quiet. No one is calling the police headquarters.
“All the other motorists who were there didn’t take pictures or videos. None of the motorists whom the policeman was helping made any attempt to stop the driver. Are policemen not humans? Don’t we also have family members? No one could even pursue the hit-and-run driver.”

The 32-year-old Amarachi Ugochukwu was said to have died after consuming an insecticide.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the incident happened on Monday within the premises of a bank.
Ugochukwu had around 1pm made her way into the restroom, where she was said to have drunk the insecticide, unknown to her colleagues. 
Other members of staff had started looking for her when the phone she left on her table kept ringing and she was not around to pick the calls.
A police source confirmed to one of our correspondents that Ugochukwu was later found dead inside the toilet with the bottle of insecticide and her suicide note.
In the suicide note obtained by our correspondent, the lady blamed the hard economy for her decision to end her life, lamenting nothing was working well for her.      
“Nothing is working in my life. My figures are low. My brain is clogged up. The economy is getting harder. My decisions are wrong. My mind is messed up. The future doesn’t seem bright at all. I see extreme hardship. I can’t bear the pain anymore,” she wrote in the suicide note.
Ugochukwu apologised to her parents and other members of her family in the suicide note.
“I’m sorry mum, I’m sorry dad, I’m sorry Nene, Okwe, Toto, Nazor, Chuchu, Ifunanya,” she added.
She concluded by writing, “Dear Lord, have mercy on me!”
PUNCH Metro gathered from sources that the manager of the bank had reported the incident to the police.
The bank manager had reportedly told the police that Ugochukwu locked herself up in the toilet to commit suicide, and she was found dead when the door was forced open.

“The corpse was removed by the police and deposited at the Ikorodu General Hospital for autopsy. The police in Lagos are investigating the incident,” a source added.        
When contacted, the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed to our correspondent that the incident happened.
“I confirm it happened,” the PPRO simply said in a text sent to our correspondent when asked about the matter on Thursday.
While expressing sadness over the incident, a Facebook user, Folusho Adebisi, claimed the late female banker combined multiple jobs to survive.
While describing her as friendly and hardworking, Adebisi wrote that aside from her banking job, the deceased also engaged in shoemaking.
He recalled how his son, Tiwalade, patronised her footwear and how he had personally met her on a few occasions.
He wrote, “Tiwalade, my son, woke me up this morning to the terrible news trending online about a young lady, Amarachi Ugochukwu, a banker committing suicide. Amarachi was a friend of Tiwalade and customer of his business, Donetsk Footwear Limited. I had met Amarachi on a few occasions when she came for deliveries at Donetsk Footwear during the festivities.
“Amarachi was a young lady, friendly, amiable and hardworking, a lady cobbler that combined her stressful job of a banker with another stressful business of shoemaking and marketing. I read she left a suicide note complaining of a hard life, hard economy etc.”      
Activist, Segun Awosanya, popularly known as Segalink on X, said the incident was a cause to continually hold people in power accountable.
“The economy is hard on us all in varying degrees. No one is spared. Not even government institutions find it difficult to operate, yet cannot complain despite being demonised unjustly by political opportunists.
“It is for this cause that we hold our political leaders, government and their MDAs accountable not because any individual is hated or targeted,” his post on X via @segalink, partly read on Thursday.
“May God Almighty grant the family the fortitude to bear the loss and may others contemplating the same find timely intervention. Please talk to someone. You are not alone in your struggle. The rich also cry. To each their own. Trying times don’t last,” he added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12013728/Amarachi-late.jpg

The inferno reportedly occurred at about 4.am at the building on Second East Circular Road, opposite New Market in Benin City, the state capital.
PUNCH Metro gathered that a majority of shopowners in the building traded used clothes and foodstuffs.
A couple identified simply as Ndidi and Blessing who operated two shops in the building, were said to have lost goods worth N10m. 
“We have lost goods worth N10m and our source of livelihood. The government should please come to our aid,” Ndidi lamented.
The fire started after repeated electric sparks from a wire connected to an electricity pole in front of one of the shops and spread to other stalls, threatening the surrounding buildings.
The timely arrival of firefighters from the Edo State Fire Service was said to have saved the situation from degenerating.        Related News  Fire destroys N80m property in Kano  LASEMA probes National Theatre fire, arrests suspected vandals  Fire destroys property in Rivers, traders lament

She said, “I went to market to buy goods and returned to the shop by 2.am and there was power outage at the time.
“I took my goods into the shops and went to my house. By 5am, I was informed on the telephone that my shop was on fire. I have prayed for those responsible for the inferno. I have lost N40m worth of goods,” she added.
“Apart from Madam Grace, Ndidi and his wife, other traders were said to have lost good worth about N30m,” an eyewitness told our correspondent.
However, when our correspondent contacted an Edo State Fire Service official in the control room, who identified herself simply as Faith, Thursday night, she said those who were on duty when the fire started were called and promptly went to the scene to put out the fire and prevented it from affecting houses close to the shops.
“Yes, our officials were called when the fire started and the fire was put out. They were also able to prevent the fire from spreading to houses close by,” she added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/13232650/Fire.jpg

Some residents told PUNCH Metro on Thursday, that they vacated the area to seek refuge in the bush, to avoid attacks and torture by men in military uniform.
They alleged that these soldiers started harassing and disrupting the peace of their communities, immediately after the terrible incident that happened in Ahoada/Abua East-West axis, on the 12th December 2023.
PUNCH Metro reports that gunmen shot four soldiers, and two drivers dead while they reportedly kidnapped two expatriates of the Daewoo company along the Ahoada/Abua East-West axis in Rivers State. 
It was learnt that men of the Nigerian Army have now occupied these communities and sacked these residents, who are currently starving in the bush, where they share homes with snakes and other reptiles in the bush.
A man, who identified to be an indigene of the Emughan Clan, Bryan Honour, said the military men invaded the communities to revenge the death of the soldiers, but they are attacking innocent civilians in the process.
“On the 12th December, unknown men killed four soldiers and two drivers, now the soldiers came back and started attacking the whole clan, which consists about four communities. They chased people, beat grandmothers, grandfathers, and two people even died.      
“All these happened because of the attack on their soldiers, and it is happening to innocent communities.
“Mothers and children have been sleeping in the bush, because of these military men. They were just beating people, some even died. Most of the youths are not with the residents in the bush, some are not even in port Harcourt due to the situation of things,” He said.

Speaking with our correspondent, a resident, Progress Ekomodi, revealed they were maltreated by the uniform men, and had to resort to living in the bush.
“It was unknown gunmen that kidnapped the white men and killed the soldiers, they were now flogging old women, chasing young women and children. The bush is now our shelter, we feed on palm kernels and water leaf. We have different camps , and we are more than two hundred in my camp here”, he said.
Another resident, Beauty Ekom, said life in the bush has been a terrible experience because every one of them is hungry and people have died as a result of lack of access to medical care and food.
“People fall sick every day in this bush, we are hungry and there is nothing to eat. Very soon, school will resume, there is no way our children will go back to school. The government should come to our rescue.
“People die in this bush every day, the stench from their decomposing bodies disturbs us. Come and help us, there is nothing to eat, we are starving. Some of our children are sick, we do not know how to treat them”, she said.        
When contacted, 6 Division, Nigeria Army Spokesperson, Jonah Danjuma, refuted the claim and clarified that the mission of the division troops deployed was to apprehend the gunmen.
“I am sure you are aware of the unprovoked and unwarranted attack on our troops by suspected militants within their vicinity on 13 December 2023. Since then, our troops have been conducting operations to fish out the perpetrators of this heinous crime.
“It is on record that our troops have a pedigree of conducting operations in line with global best practices of adhering to the rules of engagement and respect for the fundamental human rights of the citizenry.
“Thus, the allegation of harassment of innocent people is baseless, and remains largely unsubstantiated. It is also important to state that these criminals operated within their vicinity, and so they have a responsibility to expose them rather than to resort to blackmail and unwarranted propaganda”, Danjuma said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12013729/fleeing-residents.jpg

This was contained in a response sent to PUNCH Metro by the spokesperson for the agency, Joke Ladenegan-Oginni, and received by our correspondent on Thursday.
An X user identified as @Ayomiepat_, had, on Monday, shared some posts and pictures revealing the physical and mental state of Abigail, stating that the victim needed an urgent help and called on the authorities to intervene.
Part of the post read, “This girl is facing physical abuse from her brother. She’s in dire need of help. This happened because she refused to live in the apartment their father rented for them. Her reason for not wanting to live with him is his violent behaviour which is valid. This is the second time this has happened that I know of.” 
PUNCH Metro gathered that Abigail had been suffering physical assault in the hands of the elder brother since 2014.
It was learnt that the most recent experience Abigail suffered was on December 21, 2023, after which she decided to call for help and alert the relevant authorities.
Pictures which circulated online and observed by our correspondent showed that Abigail had suffered a cut in her upper left eye and bruises in other parts of her body as a result of the recent beating.      
PUNCH Metro obtained a note written by Abigail dated December 21, 2023, which was said to have been written after her brother assaulted her that day.
The note partly read, “I wish I had not been born or probably not born in our family. Maybe I won’t have Emmanuel as a brother and just be me. I just wish my next year will be better since I’m going to cut them off, and I just hope they don’t find a means to find me and make my life miserable again.”
The X user also alleged that Abigail’s family had been trying to cover up the atrocities of the brother since the abuse started.
In a voice recording, the lady was heard talking to a male voice suspected to be that of the eldest brother.  Related News  Agency recruits campus ambassadors against sexual violence  Agency seeks collaboration to combat domestic violence  Domestic, sexual violence high in Ikorodu, says agency   
“Is it until I die? In 2014, Emmanuel broke my hand. He beat me and I fainted in 2016. There was another incident in 2022 and now another one has happened. Is it until I die?” She said.
The male voice was heard threatening the victim not to report to the authorities or reveal her ordeals. The male voice further told her that he should tell the authorities that the perpetrator had run away.
“Do not try it. In your statement, say he has run away,” the male voice said.        
Another user identified as @Orioninc_ng, who confirmed the incident, said Abigail was also beaten by the landlord of the house they lived in 2023.
“Even last year, the landlord of that house beat her and her younger cousin up, and still had the guts to arrest her because while he was beating her, she was trying to fight back. He called it disrespect.”
Confirming the incident, the spokesperson, Ladenegan-Oginni, said the agency received a report of the matter and that the perpetrator had been arrested.
She said, “The agency confirms that the case was received through our social media handle; a case of physical abuse towards one Ms Abigail perpetrated by her elder brother. A referral letter to Okokomaiko Police Station was immediately sent to the client for investigation and to ensure that justice is served. The agency received feedback that the perpetrator was arrested by 9am this morning (Wednesday), and he is currently in detention.”
Ladenegan-Oginni said investigation was ongoing on the case.
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, did not pick calls nor respond to text messages sent to his phone line as of the time of filing this report.
On August 31, 2023, the Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Justice, Mrs Titilayo Shitta-Bey, during a media parley for the commemoration of the Domestic and Sexual Violence Awareness Month held at the Secretariat, Alausa, said the government received 5,624 cases of domestic and sexual violence between August 1, 2022 and July 31, 2023 with an average of 250 clients on a monthly basis.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12013730/battered-sister.jpg

Fal...",12th January 2024,https://punchng.com/lagos-nba-protesters-storm-police-hq-over-brutality-against-lawyers/,Babatunde Titilola and Temitope Aina,"A human rights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Femi Falana, has called on the Nigeria Police to conduct proper investigations into the case of brutality against lawyers in Lagos State.
Falana made the call on Thursday during a peaceful protest organised by members of the Nigerian Bar Association, Lagos, against the unlawful arrest and detention of a lawyer, Olumide Sonupe, by the police in the state.
The lawyers who are members of about five branches of the NBA marched from its Ikeja secretariat, while displaying banners, to the Command headquarters where the state Commissioner of Police, Adegoke Fayoade, addressed them.
This is coming hours after the CP had ordered the removal of the Divisional Police Officer of Moshalashi Police Station, Austin Arase, who ordered Sonupe’s detention, as reported by PUNCH Metro on January 4. 
PUNCH Metro had reported that the 36-year-old Sonupe was hospitalised after he was said to have been detained by the police while seeking the bail of his client at the Moshalashi Police Station in the Alimosho area of the state on December 30, 2023.
It was learnt that the lawyer’s health deteriorated upon his release from the police station on January 1, 2024, after spending two nights with his client in the cell.
PUNCH Metro gathered that the incident happened when Sonupe went to the station on December 30 to seek the bail of his client, a carpenter, who had been detained for an alleged breach of contract.      
The lawyer told PUNCH Metro that a woman police officer had accused him of speaking with his client by his cell without the presence of an officer.
He said while trying to clear the misunderstanding and appeal to the officers on the N30,000 bail sum demanded for his client, the DPO, Arase, came in and ordered that he should be locked up, accusing him of disrespecting the officers.
The lawyer stated that he was also accused of assaulting an officer and eventually spent two nights in the cell.
He was said to have ended up at the hospital after his release due to medical emergencies.
Following PUNCH Metro report, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, in a release obtained by our correspondent on Tuesday, disclosed that the CP had ordered the removal of the DPO who ordered the lawyer’s detention.
The release further stated that the CP had immediately ordered a probe into the matter upon the publication of the story, while noting that the police would continue to work together with the members of the NBA.  Related News  Falana slams police brutality as Lagos lawyers protest  N585m scandal: Stop insulting Nigerians, Falana tells Betta Edu  Couples who are Senior Advocates of Nigeria   
Falana who spoke during the protest on Thursday, said the NBA was ready to defend the rights of lawyers, while stating that the association had filed a report and that an investigation was ongoing.        
He said, “The five branches of the Nigerian Bar Association have come to protest police brutality on the Nigeria Police. We are making a case through him about the brutalisation of lawyers and indeed other citizens.
“The NBA wants a full investigation of the incident. We are pleased to know that the Commissioner of Police has said an investigation is ongoing and besides the report, the NBA is filing a report to protect the human rights of our colleagues.”
Speaking with PUNCH Metro, the chairman of the NBA Ikeja branch, Seyi Olawumi, said the protest was to condemn the increased rate of harassment that lawyers suffer in the hands of the police.
“It is a peaceful protest against police brutality of our members who go into police stations for the service of their clients,” he added.
Sonupe, who was accompanied by family, friends, and colleagues, said the only thing that mattered to him was to see that justice was served, while calling on the police to be thorough with their investigations.
The CP, while addressing the aggrieved lawyers, said the incident was unfortunate and promised that such issues would be avoided.
Fayoade said, “I have ordered that the DPO be removed and I have issued a departmental query to the affected DPO. This will go a long way in affecting his departmental progress. We have not in any way stopped lawyers from visiting our cell. Under my mandate, magistrates will be allowed to visit the police stations.      
“The issue of what happened to the lawyer is quite unfortunate and we will not tolerate it. When such a situation comes up, I do not think the lawyer is meant to have an altercation with the police officer. Police officers are meant to respect lawyers and lawyers are meant to respect police officers.”
On many occasions, citizens have accused the police of illegal arrest and detention as they do not attempt to arraign them to court. Some of these victims, according to reports, filed fundamental rights enforcement cases against the police for violating their human rights.
In April 2023, the NBA condemned the police for the illegal arrest and detention of its lawyers, Jerry Aondo, Dr Sobere Nelson, and Odum Eyiba, on March 31, 2023.
On December 23, 2023, The PUNCH published a report on the sad tales of victims who accused the police of indiscriminate arrest and illegal detention. Some of those victims were either forced to plead guilty to a crime they never committed or asked to pay exorbitant bail fees.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12013727/Lagos-NBA-protest.jpg

The chairman of the LG council, Bashir Sabiu, confirmed the incident, alongside the spokesman for the Katsina police command, ASP Abubakar Aliyu.
The PUNCH gathered that the bandits attacked the village a few minutes before midnight and operated till around 1:30 am on Thursday.
Villagers said the bandits took time to go from house to house in search of valuables, including money.     
Sources further disclosed that the bandits killed the village head, his four children, and four others in the process.
It could not be established whether they abducted people or went away with valuables.
The state Commissioner for Internal Security, Nasiru Muazu who spoke on the incident through his spokesman, Hassan Dan-Alli, said, “The state is committed to the protection of lives and property of people of the state. We shall not relent in our efforts to ensure that our people are safe wherever they are.”      
Efforts were being made to bury the victims on Thursday, when this report was filed.
The PUNCH reports that the bandits killed no fewer than six traders last Friday morning who were on their way to a local market at Yantumaki in the Danmusa Local Government Area of the state.
The traders, who were travelling from Maidabino, were attacked just a few kilometres from the market.  Related News  Bandits abduct 23 in Abuja  Bandits abduct Zamfara lecturer, kill nine in Katsina attack  FG mulls special force to rid forests of bandits   
Former Secretary to the Katsina State Government, Alhaji Inuwa Mustapha, has, however, urged governors of North-Western States to jointly tackle banditry instead of doing it individually as currently being done.
He insists that no state can single-handedly tackle the problem.
Inuwa, who is a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, in an interview with The PUNCH, also advised the governors to put pressure on the federal government to assist them in tackling banditry and other crimes in the region.
The former SSG insists that tackling banditry in the North-West Region requires “well-coordinated, sustainable and simultaneous operations against bandits.”        
He said, “I will keep on saying this. Bandits may be large in numbers but they are not large enough to be a threat to national security if they are well tackled.
“In the first instance, there is no state in Nigeria that can single-handedly tackle insecurity. It requires the collaborative efforts and support of others including that of the Federal Government. If you could recollect, from January 2017 to 2019 Katsina put in several strategies to tackle insecurity, especially banditry.
“We put up amnesty, met the bandits’ leaders, banned sales of fuel in jerry cans, closed cattle markets, shut down communication in some councils. But you know, these bandits are mobile, highly mobile. When you put up measures that are unfavourable to them in your state, they move to other states where they will be operating from.
“Let the Governors come together; let them put pressure on the Federal Government.

Janbako, who is also a senior lecturer at the university’s Department of Islamic Studies, was kidnapped in his residence in Damba Gusau, the state capital on Wednesday.
A resident of the area, Nasamu Garba told The PUNCH that the bandits broke into Janbako’s residence around 2 a.m. on Wednesday and took him away.
Garba said security personnel engaged the bandits in a gun duel in a bid to foil the abduction. 
He said, “When the bandits arrived at the residence of Bello Janbako, they fired several gunshots in order to frighten the residents of the area.
“They later broke into the house and abducted him but were confronted by the security personnel who arrived the area on a rescue mission.
“There was a serious fight between the bandits and the security personnel.      
“Unfortunately, the bandits overpowered the security personnel due to their numbers and ran back to the forest with Bello Janbako.”  Related News  13 Zamfara undergraduates, corpers spend Christmas in bandits’ den  Varsity seeks abducted students’ release, matriculates 2,865 freshers  Bandits kidnap Taraba chief, pregnant daughter, 19 others

“The bandits have been attacking us and have abducted many people from this area despite its closeness to the Government House Gusau.
“If the people of Damba area are not safe, one can say that the whole state is now controlled by bandits.”

metro-plus,How my husband defiled my sister’s granddaughter – Witness,"A Prosecution Witness, Olayemi Hosa, on Wednesday narrated to the Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court how her husband, Olumuyiwa Adjoto, allegedly raped her sister’s six-year-old grand...",11th January 2024,https://punchng.com/how-my-husband-defiled-my-sisters-granddaughter-witness/,Onozure Dania,"A Prosecution Witness, Olayemi Hosa, on Wednesday narrated to the Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court how her husband, Olumuyiwa Adjoto, allegedly raped her sister’s six-year-old granddaughter, at their home in Mowo, Badagry, Lagos in 2022.
Hosa, a trader who spoke in Yoruba and translated in English language, told Justice Rahman Oshodi that the victim had come to spend the Easter holidays in their home when the defendant defiled her.
She testified that the incident happened on April 19, 2022, when the victim came for a two-week Easter holiday.
The defendant is standing trial for alleged defilement of the minor who is now eight years old. 
The witness who was led in evidence in chief by the Lagos State prosecution counsel Inumidun Solarin told the court that before the incident occurred, she had asked the victim to go and greet the defendant on Wednesday morning when she woke up.
She stated that the victim came to inform her that her husband gave her money and she then asked the victim what she said to the defendant and she replied that she told him “Thank you”.
Hosa, who is the second prosecution witness, narrated that she had left her sister’s granddaughter at home with her husband to go to Idumota Market, adding that upon arrival, she found out that the girl had been sexually defiled by her husband.      
She said, “On Friday, I went to Idumota Market around 5:00 a.m or 6:00 a.m, by that time, I couldn’t wake her (victim) up nor make other arrangements. So, I left her at home. By afternoon, I missed Olumuyiwa’s call but I didn’t have call card to call back, so, I returned around 5:00 p.m.
“When I got to the gate, I noticed the girl was unhappy and I thought that was because I left her at home to go out.”
The witness said the girl was moody and after the family’s dinner, she asked the victim to follow her outside so they could get fresh air outside their apartment as there was no light.
She further told the court, “As I sat down and put her on my lap, she heaved a painful sigh and jumped up. I asked what happened and she said ‘My bum, bum, it is Daddy.’”
According to her, she ran into the house with the child, placed her on the bed and asked her what Daddy did to her.
Quoting the minor, “She said when I was writing, ‘Daddy put his hand in my bum, bum and his penis and I was shouting. He asked me to keep quiet. He slapped me and covered my mouth with a white clothe. After he was done, he cleaned me with a white handkerchief and said I should go out and play with a friend.’”
The witness told the court that she took the child to General Hospital in Badagry, where a medical doctor examined her genitals.        
She stated that the doctor asked the child questions, and the victim insisted that it was the defendant who sexually abused her.  Related News  Ogun NSCDC arrests man for defiling lover's teenage daughter  Bricklayer bags life imprisonment for raping teenager  Father defiles 12-year-old daughter   
Hosa further stated that the doctor asked her to go get a police report before she could be given a medical report.
The witness said when she reported the incident at the Badagry Police Station, officers followed her to arrest her husband.
She added that on getting to the alleged crime scene, the police officers realised the defendant was a well-known person to them.
Hosa then accused the police of trying to overturn the matter, stating that they started shouting at her.
She claimed she searched and called the Mirabel Centre.
The prosecution witness also explained, “I called Mirabel, they now sent a document through my phone to fill and then I attached it to the doctor’s report.”      
She said the police later took him to court.
“I took her to Mirabel where a test was conducted on her and Mirabel gave me a letter to the Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, and I was told that the matter was in court but the DSVA said they wanted to go and check my file at the Department of Public Prosecutions and it was discovered that the file at the DPP’s office got missing as the file was empty. I was asked if I had copies of the result I said yes. So, I had to go home to get it and they replaced the results in the file, with the copies I had,” she added.
Under cross-examination, Hosa maintained that she left the girl at home with her husband because it was too early to wake the child and take her to a house close by for lessons where she use to play with her age mates, though she claimed her husband had earlier accused her of preventing him from relating with the child.
She told the defence counsel who queried why she left the alleged victim with her husband whom she had earlier claimed while being led in evidence in chief that she had similar experiences with him, but she stated that she thought that since the girl is a minor her husband wouldn’t mess with her.
The witness said the child informed her that the time of the incident was in the afternoon.
In a bit to puncture the evidence of the witness, the defendant’s lawyer also asked her, “Did you know that the defendant was out for most of that day and did not come back until 5:00 p.m?”
Hosa insisted, and said, “The girl told me they were together that he did not go out, so it was what she told me and that was what the doctor confirmed and that is what I have come to tell the court.”  
However, Justice Oshodi adjourned the case to March 12, 2024, for continuation of trial.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/30020857/SPECIAL-OFFENSE-COURT.jpg

In an announcement published on The PUNCH on Wednesday, the victims were said to be travelling in a white SUV with number plate – KSF-456-HD when they were last heard from.
“A group of five people (two Chinese, three Nigerian) on a business trip from Onitsha to Aba have been missing within the Eastern part of Nigeria since 3rd December 2023 and every effort to search for them proves abortive:
“They travelled in a white colour 4runner SUV car with registration number: KSF456HD (picture of a car shown above). We request the general public to help us in search of the car or the people in it.

He said, “This is not their first time going there. The Chinese people don’t live here in Nigeria. They only come to do their business survey, meet their customers and their partners, and then they go back.”
Another colleague, who identified himself simply as Ben, said, “The expatriates arrived on November 19 and two weeks after, they embarked on the trip. There was communication with them that day and that was the last time we heard from them. We called all the phone numbers of people in the car and none of them went through. That was how we immediately reported to the police stations in Aba and Onitsha. Up till now, we have not got any call from anybody. They stayed in Onitsha for more than two weeks.”

Bachaka, who served as the chairman of the Gudu Local Government Area between April 2021 and April 2023, stated this while testifying before the judicial Commission of enquiry constituted by the Governor of Sokoto State to investigate sales and auctions of government property.
Bachaka told the commission that towards the end of their tenure, his beloved wife and two of his children were kidnapped and such a situation necessitated him to sell the monetised Toyota Hilux vehicle and paid the ransom to the bandits to free his family members.
The witness who testified on Tuesday before the commission’s Presiding Judge, Justice Mu’azu Pindiga, also maintained that he sold the vehicle and paid over N4m to the bandits before they released the three family members to him. 
He said, “I sold the vehicle that was monetised to me at the cost N4.2m, which was deducted from my over N5m total gratuity and severance allowances.
“I have no option than to dispose the monetised Toyota Hilux vehicle to pay the ransom to the bandits.
“After bargaining with the kidnappers, I took the said amount to the bandits in one of the villages in Wurno Local Government Area of the state where I paid them the money after which they freed and handed over the abductees to me safely.”      
Bachaka pleaded with the Sokoto State Government to consider their present predicament saying currently, he could not afford to buy or refund the vehicle’s money as their gratuities and other allowances were not being paid.

“I was invited to give what I know about the Toyota vehicle which was monetised to us by the former Sokoto State administration.
“The vehicles were auctioned to us with an agreement that the state government would pay vehicles’ money from our benefits, emoluments, gratuities and furniture allowances to settle the payment.”
He lamented that they were not settled their remaining gratuities after the payment of the vehicles as agreed upon in the Memorandum of Understanding, saying, “Unfortunately, our remaining retirement allowances balance was not paid till this moment.
“Government should consider our present predicament as our balance has not been paid.
“We were not given a single kobo in the name of our retirement benefit despite that we served for two years as local government chairmen.
“The former administration had deducted huge amounts from our furniture and gratuities allowance to pay the Hilux Toyota vehicles and they have not given us any documents to prove the payments of the vehicles.”

The newborn, a baby boy, was said to have been stolen a few hours after his birth on Tuesday, January 9, 2024, by a yet-to-be-identified stranger.
Speaking on the development during a press briefing in Lafia on Wednesday, the Commissioner of Police, Umar Shehu Nadada, said three suspects had so far been arrested in connection with the matter.
He said, “Yesterday (Tuesday), one Suleiman Abdullahi of Timber Shade went to A Division Police Station and reported that his wife had a Caesarean Section at the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia. 
“He narrated that his brother’s wife who was assisting his wife wanted to go home to get a charger but unfortunately handed over the child to an unknown woman.
“But when she came back to the ward, she could not find the child and the woman. That was how the matter was reported to us.
“I don’t think the matter is connected to ritualists but investigation is ongoing at the State Criminal Investigation Department.      
The outcome of the investigation will be communicated to journalists in due time.”
Meanwhile, findings by our correspondent indicated that the incident occurred around 6am at the Post-natal Ward of the state-owned Specialist Hospital when the caregiver left the baby in the care of the stranger.

When interviewed to get her reaction on the development, the mother of the one-day-old baby, Wosilat Suleiman, said, “My relation who was looking after me introduced the strange woman she met in the ward to me before she went home to pick something.
“She told me that the woman would take care of me and the baby before she returned from the house.
“My relation thought the woman had a patient at the ward and she trusted her to help us before she returned.
“The woman told me she wanted to bathe the baby and disappeared with him.”
She, therefore, appealed to the relevant authorities to help her find her baby as she was going through unimaginable pains over the loss of her child.        
Reacting to the incident, the Acting Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of the hospital, Dr. Mohammed Salihu, said it was the first time that such a thing happened in the healthcare facility.
He further said that the management was collaborating with the police to unravel the suspect behind the dastardly act.
“Already, the relations of the mother of the baby have been arrested and some of our staff on duty were invited by the police for questioning.

Fubara, while expressing deepest grief over the unfortunate boat accident, described the incident as unfortunate.
The governor in a statement issued by his media aide, Boniface Onyedi, in Port Harcourt on Wednesday condoled and sympathised with the affected families of the dead and indeed all the victims of the boat accident.
The incident involving a cargo wooden boat occurred after a violent wave struck the ferry and destroyed its parts leading to the crash which also claimed about four children. 
Fubara assured the people that his administration would continue to work to ensure that travelling on the sea routes becomes safer for travellers and the riverine community dwellers.
The statement reads, “I commiserate and condole with families of the victims of the boat accident that led to the loss of lives, and near death experienced by our brothers and sisters who were involved in the boat accident.
“It is indeed a very unfortunate and sad incident and we pray that God shall give all of them the strength to bear the loss and speedy recovery to those who survived.      
“As a government, we will continue to work to ensure that such threats against safe travelling on our sea routes are tackled.”
Meanwhile, the Rivers State Police Command has faulted widespread reports that about 20 people died in the ill-fated accident and put the casualty figure at 11.
The spokesperson for the command, Grace Iringe-Koko, in a statement issued on Wednesday said the wooden boat was powered by a single 25HP Yamaha engine carrying passengers from Ukwa Community in Ngo town in Andoni LGA, en route Bonny Island at about 8pm when the incident occurred and the boat sank.
The two-paragraph statement read, “On 09/01/2024 at about 0915hrs , information received that a local wooden boat powered by a single 25HP Yamaha engine carrying passengers from Ukwa Community in Ngo town in Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, en route Bonny Island, sank while approaching Amariaria community in Finima town on 08/01/2024 at 2000hrs.
“On the strength of the information, the Officer in-Change of Marine, SP Ogarachi Chima, moved to the scene of incident of the boat accident and discovered 11 passengers feared drowned. Investigation is in progress.”
One of the victims and owner of the wooden boat, Pastor Promise Festus from Ngo Town in Andoni has cried out for help to Fubara and the LGA chairman, Chief Erastus Awortu, following the unfortunate demise of his five children.
Festus’ sons and daughters were part of the victims of the wooden boat that capsized.        
The unfortunate incident which happened on Tuesday evening threw the pastor into deep agony, as his five children were among the 11 persons who died in the boat accident.

In a viral video seen by our reporter, Festus said, “I went to celebrate Christmas with my people. So, on the way coming back, January 8, I loaded people who had no money to pay transport with my family. Incidentally, our boat capsized in front of the LNG, where there is no rescue.
“So, about 11 people died and out of that 11 people, five are my sons and daughters, five are my children.
“We lost everything and there is no way for me even to survive. Everything in my life; phone, money that I will carry survive myself.
“Everything, my boat, and other things. No business, no way and the way to start I don’t know.
“In my presence, my children died. In my presence, people wey survive with me dey cry, cry, cry, no way.
“I want the state government and Andoni Local Government to assist me. To forgive any sin that I committed and assist me,” he stated while sobbing uncontrollably.      
Our reporter gathered that most of the victims were said to be from Ngo town, Ataba, and Isiama communities in Andoni Local Government Area.
Speaking on the incident, the Chairman of a group, Obolo Youths Coalition, Bonny LGA chapter, Gogo Obolo, in a telephone chat, said the passengers were returning from Ngo town in Andoni LGA to Bonny Island when the unfortunate accident occurred.
While expressing worry that none of the affected victims had been recovered, he urged the Chairman of Andoni LGA, Chief Erastus Awortu, and his counterpart in Bonny LGA to expedite action to recover the bodies of the victims and extend a hand of support to their families.
Obolo stated, “The Andoni people residing in Bonny received the shocking news of our brothers and sisters involved in a boat accident while returning from the Christmas celebrations.
“While we pray that the rescue effort will yield more success to reduce the pain of the accident, we implore the Andoni local government chairman, Chief Erastus Awortu and his counterpart in Bonny, Dame Anengi Barasua, to visit the families of the victims in this trying period.”
The Chairman of Andoni LGA, Awortu, who also confirmed the boat accident, said he immediately dispatched a rescue team upon receiving a distress call which led to the rescue of some persons.
Awortu, in a statement he personally signed and obtained by our correspondent on Wednesday morning commiserated with the families of those who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident and promised to take over the medical bills of those rescued.  
He however warned people and residents of Andoni to stop embarking on night journeys on sea and asked boat operators to always comply strictly with safety rules.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/31123342/Siminalayi-Fubara-2-e1698752022771.png

The three-time champions open their campaign against Equatorial Guinea in Abidjan on Sunday with a team spearheaded by African footballer of the year, Victor Osimhen.
Even with a series of withdrawals, Nigeria can call on some of Africa’s best attackers, including Kelechi Iheanacho, Terem Moffi, Samuel Chukwueze, Moses Simon and Ademola Lookman.
But there is nothing like the same strength in depth elsewhere, with concerns in particular about the goalkeeping position. 
Francis Uzoho of Omonia Nicosia in Cyprus has been the first-choice goalkeeper in recent matches.
Peseiro said, “I believe in my players, in all of them from the goalkeeper to the striker,” Peseiro told reporters in Abidjan.
“Every team sometimes has more power in certain positions. It happens to all national teams.      
“It is my job and responsibility to create a good organisation, but the main point is that I believe in them.”
Nigeria has been hit by injuries, with Bayer Leverkusen’s Victor Boniface, Real Sociedad’s Umar Sadiq and Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi all pulling out close to the kick-off.
Peseiro confirmed that Moffi, of French Ligue 1 side Nice, will not arrive in time to feature against Equatorial Guinea, while Iheanacho and late addition Paul Onuachu had only just landed in Ivory Coast.
“Kelechi arrived at 4 this morning and so he is completely recovered,” Peseiro said.  Related News  VIDEO: Yemi Alade performs at AFCON opening ceremony  AFCON: Ivory Coast vs Guinea Bissau (PREVIEW)  AFCON: Heavy traffic in Abidjan ahead of opening match   
“Boniface is injured but Moffi arrives tomorrow at 8 p.m. Sadiq is injured also, and Onuachu arrived at 4 a.m. this morning.
“The (injured) players are sad, but we have 25 players with quality.”
All eyes are on Osimhen, described by Nigeria captain Ahmed Musa as “the king of Africa.”        
Yet the Super Eagles have not convinced recently, losing to Guinea in their last warm-up game.
Their chances of reaching the 2026 World Cup finals have already been compromised after draws in qualifying against Lesotho and Zimbabwe in November.
“The last game in World Cup qualifying was not good, but until now we have only lost one (competitive) game, at home to Guinea-Bissau, in which we created many opportunities,” insisted Peseiro.
Nigeria will face Guinea-Bissau at the AFCON and will have the chance to avenge that reverse in qualifying in Abuja.
“Playing for Nigeria is not easy, with the history, the stress, the pressure. The people of Nigeria want to win, like us.
“I am not afraid for me and my team. They need to answer on the pitch. We need to understand the criticism. We have been playing well, but the results in those matches are in the past. This is a different competition,” he stated.

Kosovo captain Rrahmani capitalised on dreadful defending at a free-kick to poke home the winner and turn jeers into cheers at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.
Walter Mazzarri’s side moved up to sixth in Italy’s top flight after the win. The hosts came back from going behind in the 29th minute to a stunning Antonio Candreva strike.

Palmer converted a pen...,13th January 2024,https://punchng.com/palmer-sinks-fulham-to-lift-chelsea-gloom/,Makua Ubanagu,"Cole Palmer fired Chelsea to a 1-0 win against west London rivals Fulham on Saturday as the inconsistent Blues bounced back from their League Cup embarrassment at Middlesbrough.
Palmer converted a penalty late in the first half at Stamford Bridge to erase the bitter taste from Chelsea’s shock 1-0 loss against second-tier Middlesbrough in the semi-final first leg on Tuesday.
That League Cup calamity was just the latest disappointment in a troubled season for Mauricio Pochettino’s side.
Chelsea were hardly much more dynamic against Fulham, but Pochettino will take heart from the way they ground out a third successive Premier League victory.


  
After a 10-day winter break, the Blues will have a chance to overturn the League Cup deficit when they return to action against Middlesbrough in the second leg on January 23.
Chelsea are still a work in progress in Pochettino’s first season, with his decision to go with a largely youthful team inevitably producing highs and lows.
In the circumstances, Fulham were ideal opponents for Chelsea to lift the gloom, given they are without a win at the Bridge since 1979.      
The clubs are separated by just two miles in west London, but they have traditionally been light years apart in terms of success on the pitch.
Chelsea’s recent struggles had allowed Fulham to dream of a rare victory on enemy turf and there was audible frustration among Blues fans as soon as passes started to go astray from their spluttering team.
That angst transmitted to the pitch as Chelsea laboured to establish any rhythm, with Conor Gallagher’s wayward strike from distance epitomising their struggles.
•⁠ ⁠Palmer keeps cool –
Nicolas Jackson’s absence on Senegal duty at the Africa Cup of Nations and Christopher Nkunku’s latest injury have diminished Pochettino’s attacking options.
Armando Broja was deputising for Jackson, but he wasted a good chance when he headed wide from Enzo Fernandez’s cross.  Related News  De Bruyne inspires Man City comeback to stun Newcastle  Dortmund sign Maatsen on loan from Chelsea  I never wanted to leave Man City - Palmer   
Looking to capitalise on Chelsea’s woes, Fulham launched an incisive break that ended with Harry Wilson’s close-range effort forcing a good save from Djordje Petrovic.
When another Chelsea attack petered out, Fulham fans mocked the hosts’ expensively assembled side with chants of “what a waste of money”.        
Despite their lethargic display, Chelsea rallied to take the lead in first-half stoppage time.
Issa Diop conceded a penalty with a rash challenge on Raheem Sterling and Palmer stepped up to smash the spot-kick past Bernd Leno.
It was the 21-year-old’s nerveless fifth successful penalty for Chelsea showed why team-mates have nicknamed him ‘Cold Palmer’.
With nine goals since signing from Manchester City in September, Palmer has been one of the few bright spots in Chelsea’s troubled campaign.
Driving forward with intent, Palmer curled just wide early in the second half.
Chelsea lost their way again as the half wore on and Fulham striker Raul Jimenez headed over before testing Petrovic with a dangerous low strike.
Gallagher hit the woodwork with a clever effort using the outside of his foot, but Fulham finished strongly and only some last-ditch defending stopped the Blues suffering fresh indignity.      
With Chelsea just about holding on, there was good news in the closing minutes when England left-back Ben Chilwell made his return from four months out with a hamstring injury.

The Special Assistant to Govenor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Sports, Mr Damilare Orimoloye, said this in an interview with NAN.
Orimoloye, at the monthly ‘Keep Fit Lagos’ programme organised by the state government, promised that Lagos residents would have more to cheer during the AFCON matches.
He said, “The idea to increase the AFCON viewing centres across Lagos State is in line with the THEME Plus Agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, which emphasises social inclusion.


  
“The idea is that our people will have the opportunity to go out and mingle while watching the AFCON 2023; people will come out to interact with other football fans.
“This project will increase bonding and networking among our people in a more friendly environment.
“We now have five additional centres added to the previous 15 which makes a total of 20 centres across Lagos, which will enhance more proximity so that more people will come out.”        Related News  VIDEO: Yemi Alade performs at AFCON opening ceremony  AFCON: Ivory Coast vs Guinea Bissau (PREVIEW)  AFCON: Heavy traffic in Abidjan ahead of opening match   
The Director General of Lagos State Sports Commission, Oluwatoyin Gafaar, noted that more side attractions had been introduced at the viewing centres.
He said, “Last two years, we had 15, but this time around we are making it 20 centres, and we will continue to expand.
“Lagos government is ready to provide all the needed support to the people as dictated by Governor Sanwo-Olu. We want to increase the atmosphere of bonding in Lagos State.
“The centres will be opened at 3pm and will remain open until the last match is played. The centres are not for Nigeria’s fixtures alone, but all the matches of AFCON 2023.
“Other incentives include feeding the spectators, drinks, pop corn, among others. It’s going to be an exciting moment for football fans in Lagos during AFCON 2023.”

He added that the Super Eagles possessed the needed qualities to win the biggest football showpiece in Africa.
“If we play as a unit, I don’t see any nation at this AFCON that can stop us.


  
“With God on our side and the quality of players in this present Super Eagles, we will do it again,” Awoniyi said.
Awoniyi said he was disappointed not to be part of the tournament but had no reason to question God because he believed everything happened for good.

The Nigerian striker underwent surgery and was declared out for months according to his then coach Steve Cooper.
Cooper said, “It’s bad news on Taiwo, he’s had to have surgery and he is going to be out for months.
“We’ll support him and try to get him back as quick and as fit as he can be, but it’s a really unfortunate situation and a blow for him.”
Awoniyi also showed support after learning that his teammate Victor Boniface was also ruled out of the competition on January 8.

The former commissioner said that in spite of the team’s poor showings recently, Nigerians have shown them tremendous love and support.


  
“President Bola Tinubu has taken the lead by approving funds for the payment of team’s entitlements as this should adequately motivate the team.
“The team should find a way to improve on its performances and prove critics who have written them off,” he said.

Akpuenika urged Nigerians to pray for the team to win a fourth AFCON title for the country.
“God can change the challenges currently facing the team and make it put smiles on the faces of Nigerians.

sports,Djokovic to Sinner: Five men to watch at Australian Open,"Novak Djokovic is targeting an 11th Australian Open crown and a record 25th Grand Slam title. In the absence of injured Rafael Nadal, several younger players are out to stop him. AFP Sport highlights ...",13th January 2024,https://punchng.com/djokovic-to-sinner-five-men-to-watch-at-australian-open/,Agency Report,"Novak Djokovic is targeting an 11th Australian Open crown and a record 25th Grand Slam title. In the absence of injured Rafael Nadal, several younger players are out to stop him.
AFP Sport highlights five men to watch when the first Grand Slam of the year begins on Sunday:
Novak Djokovic
He may be 36 but the 24-time Grand Slam winner is still the man to beat after another hugely successful 2023, which included overcoming Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Melbourne final.


  
The Serbian finished the year as world number one after winning three of the four majors, with only Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon denying him a clean sweep.
In total, Djokovic claimed seven titles to take his career haul to 98, including a record-equalling seventh ATP Tour Finals crown.
A right wrist injury troubled him during his defeat to Alex de Minaur at the United Cup in Perth, but he now says he is “pain-free.”      
Carlos Alcaraz
The 20-year-old Spaniard’s triumph over Djokovic on the grass at Wimbledon reinforced his status as the hottest prospect in men’s tennis.
His breakthrough for a maiden Slam title at the US Open in 2022 made him the youngest champion of a men’s major since compatriot Nadal at the 2005 French Open.
He also became the youngest man to ascend to world number one.
Now ranked number two, Alcaraz heads into the Australian Open as a serious contender after a year in which he collected six titles.
The unanswered question is whether he can overcome Djokovic on the blue hard courts of Melbourne, where the Serbian has dominated for so long.
Since Wimbledon, the pair have played twice, both on hard courts. Djokovic won both times.        
Daniil Medvedev
The 27-year-old Russian is a two-time finalist at the opening Grand Slam of the year. He was outplayed by Djokovic in 2021 before a heart-wrenching defeat by Nadal a year later.  Related News  Tennis: Nadal out of Australian Open with muscle tear  Tennis: Djokovic resists 'suffocating' Rublev to book Dimitrov title clash  Djokovic beats Medvedev to win 24th Grand Slam   
That narrow defeat in 2022 had a profound impact on Medvedev, who struggled to recapture the same form for the rest of the year and slipped out of the world’s top 10.
But a resurgent 2023 has again thrust him into the conversation as a title contender after winning 66 matches, more than any other player on tour last year.
The 2021 US Open champion is back up to world number three and will begin his bid for a second major title after a low-key build-up, skipping warm-up tournaments to focus on training.
Jannik Sinner
The 22-year-old Italian enjoyed a breakthrough in 2023, winning his first Masters title, in Toronto, and making the championship match against Djokovic at the ATP Finals.      
He was also instrumental in helping Italy win the Davis Cup, beating Djokovic in three sets along the way.
It led to plenty of praise and expectations that it is only a matter of time before the former champion skier wins a major.
At a career-high four in the world, Sinner also won titles in Montpellier, Vienna and Beijing last season, notching wins over Alcaraz and Medvedev in the Chinese capital.
Alex de Minaur
The Australian has emerged as a threat at his home Grand Slam after a sensational start to the year, beating three top-10 players in a row at the United Cup.
They included Djokovic in straight sets, with Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz also falling victim to a player who spent the off-season improving his serve and backhand.
It has propelled the 24-year-old into the top 10, the first Australian to hold a top-10 spot since former world number one Lleyton Hewittin July 2006.  
De Minaur’s best result in a major is the quarter-finals at the US Open in 2020 and he has never gone beyond the fourth round at Melbourne Park.
But he will approach the tournament full of confidence, aiming to become the first Australian man to win his home Slam since Mark Edmondsonin1976.

The Spanish gian...,13th January 2024,https://punchng.com/hungry-madrid-in-better-form-but-barca-strong-says-xavi/,Makua Ubanagu,"Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez admitted Saturday that “hungry” rivals Real Madrid are in better form but insisted his side are strong and can retain the Spanish Super Cup.
The Spanish giants do battle in Sunday’s Clasico final in Saudi Arabia, a repeat of last year’s showdown in which the Catalans excelled to lift the first trophy of Xavi’s reign.
Barcelona went on to win La Liga and although his team trail leaders Madrid by seven points this season, the coach insisted he has a “winning project”.
“We will try to dominate the game, impose our personality, our way of playing and dominate the ball,” Xavi told a news conference in Riyadh on Saturday.


  
“We arrive in little less form than Real Madrid, but when the ball is rolling there will be no favourites.”
Record 14-time Super Cup champions Barcelona are third in La Liga and suffered surprise defeats by Shakhtar Donetsk and Royal Antwerp in the Champions League, although they qualified for the knock-out phase top of their group regardless.
Xavi insisted he is calm about the situation after the success of last season.      
“A trophy is at stake, I arrive in a much more comfortable position than last season — we have won, we’ve shown this is a winning project, I’m calmer,” continued Xavi.
“Madrid are always hungry (and) this is a strong Barca, we’re on a stage which is ideal, it gives me so much motivation and we will give everything.”  Related News  Real Madrid edge Atletico 5-3 to reach Super Cup final  Rudiger scrapes Madrid's tight win over Mallorca  Kylian Mbappe's future to dominate transfer window   
Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said defender Dani Carvajal was fit to play despite not training with his team-mates on Friday.
The coach would not reveal whether Kepa Arrizabalaga or Andriy Lunin would start in goal.
“I don’t want to give away any clues,” explained Ancelotti.
“At the moment I don’t feel like I can pick one to be starter and one to be substitute, and I think both of them understand that.”
Ancelotti has the chance to match Zinedine Zidane as Madrid’s second most successful coach ever with victory in the final to bring him an 11th trophy at the helm of Los Blancos.        
Miguel Munoz won 14 as Real Madrid manager between 1960-1974, including nine La Liga titles and two European Cups.
Ancelotti said he was pleased at the chance to level Zidane but he was always looking forward, hunting for more.
“Trophies stay in the cupboard, you look at them now and again, they are memories, but the important thing is the next day,” added the coach.

The Super Eagles begin their AFCON campaign in Ivory Coast against Equatorial Guinea on Sunday before also facing the hosts and outsiders, Guinea-Bissau, in Group A.
Nigeria is looking to win a fourth Cup of Nations, which would see them draw level with the tally of rivals Ghana, and their attacking armada is what made them appear genuine contenders to go all the way.
Osimhen, 25, won the African Player of the Year award off the back of his brilliant form in Napoli’s run to the Serie A title. 
He scored 26 goals for his club last season to become one of the most coveted forwards in world football, although he has struggled in comparison in this campaign, netting only eight times.
Osimhen also struck 10 times in AFCON qualifying, even if seven of his goals came against minnows Sao Tome and Principe.
This is a big tournament for him after he hardly featured as Nigeria finished third at the 2019 AFCON and sat out the last edition two years ago due to a combination of a facial injury and a bout of Covid.      
“I want to win the AFCON with my country and write my own legacy. All the greats in Nigeria have a title to their name and to be mentioned in that space I must win it too,” he told Al Jazeera recently, as the Super Eagles aim to win the continental title for the first time since 2013.
– Attacking depth –
Boniface could have been his partner, with the 23-year-old excited about the AFCON after scoring 16 goals for Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen in the first half of the season.
But the forward, who made his international debut in September, will play no part in Ivory Coast after succumbing to a groin injury.
“Of course, for every player from Nigeria it is always their dream to represent their country — and win a trophy for their country,” Boniface told media including AFP in December.
Withdrawing so close to the kick-off is a huge blow for a player who has previously suffered two serious knee ligament injuries in his career.  Related News  VIDEO: Yemi Alade performs at AFCON opening ceremony  AFCON: Ivory Coast vs Guinea Bissau (PREVIEW)  AFCON: Heavy traffic in Abidjan ahead of opening match   
His place in the squad has been taken by Terem Moffi, and the very fact the powerful Nice striker was not initially included shows how strong Nigeria is in attack.        
“Every kid in Nigeria wants to be a goalscorer and wants to be noticed,” Super Eagles legend Jay-Jay Okocha told media including AFP in December.
“Also the fans might have something to do with it — we don’t forgive defenders if they score an own goal, but we forgive strikers if they miss a chance.”
Coach Jose Peseiro can also call on Samuel Chukwueze of AC Milan, Moses Simon of Nantes and Ademola Lookman, who is doing well at Atalanta in Italy this season.
Kelechi Iheanacho of Leicester City is expected to be fit too, but Nottingham Forest forward, Taiwo Awoniyi, has already been ruled out.
Then Real Sociedad striker, Umar Sadiq, got injured in Nigeria’s final warm-up friendly against Guinea, leading to a late call-up for giant forward Paul Onuachu, currently at Trabzonspor.
A team that has also lost Leicester midfielder Wilfred Ndidi appears to lack the necessary quality elsewhere, so Peseiro needs Osimhen to deliver the goals.
“We qualified with more goals scored (22) than any other side because we play one of the most attacking styles of football among all African national teams,” Peseiro told Portuguese daily O Jogo.      
“I signed for Nigeria with the objective of being able to win the AFCON, because I knew all about the quality of the players, the history of the team and the possibility that we could be champions with the resources we have.”
Yet, Peseiro knows of the need to be wary of Nigeria’s group-stage opponents, including a Guinea-Bissau side who beat them 1-0 in qualifying in Abuja.
“The gap has been bridged when it comes to African football — we don’t really have minnows anymore,” warnedOkocha.

Umar and Boniface have been ruled out of the 2023 African Cup of Nations with injuries and were replaced by Paul Onuachu and Terem Moffi for the competition which is scheduled to start on Saturday (today) in Ivory Coast.
Umar picked up a knee injury in Nigeria’s 2-0 friendly defeat to the Syli Stars of Guinea on Monday and in a statement posted on X by the official Super Eagles account on Friday, it was announced that Onuachu will replace the 26-year-old.
“Sadiq Umar is out of the AFCON 2023 squad due to injury and Paul Onuachu replaces him,” they wrote.


  
Onuachu was at the AFCON 2019 finals in Egypt. However, due to an injury, the 29-year-old missed the previous edition of the competition in Cameroon. In 15 games for Trabzonspor this season, the forward has scored nine goals and three assists.
Nigerians took to social media platform, X, and queried Peseiro’s decision to not invite Gift Orban as a potential replacement even after he has had two injured strikers.
Timothy North believes that the Eagles will need an hustler like Orban, who finished as Nigeria’s highest goalscorer in Europe in 2023.

Olaseni Feyisayo wondered if they didn’t know about Oraban’s exploits as he asked, “You guys don’t know about Gift Orban ?”

The 34th edition of the tournament is considered one of the most wide-open in recent times, with several teams capable of lifting the title on February 11.
The Super Eagles are in Group A alongside hosts, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau
This group is straightforward on paper as Ivory Coast and Nigeria have better players than the other two nations, so, most would fancy both to easily progress to the knockout stages.
The Elephants are hosting the event for the second time and are looking for their third continental title. They last won it in 2015 at the tail end of their Golden Generation. They have a young squad led by the experienced Max Gradel, who was part of the 2015 title-winning team. The likes of Sebastien Haller, Nicolas Pepe, Ibrahim Snagare, and Franck Kessie should make qualification easy for the hosts.


  
Meanwhile, Nigeria have been accused many times for underachieving at the tournament. They have reigning African Player of the Year Victor Osimhen in their strike force, so they are expected to get through. They are making their 20th AFCON appearance and are eyeing a fourth continental title.
Equatorial Guinea finished fourth in 2015, so they could be a problem for the two fancied nations. They have exciting players who play across Europe.
Guinea-Bissau will be playing in their fourth AFCON tournament and they will face the hosts in the opening game, which is daunting. Their clash with Equatorial Guinea will be huge if they both lose to the West African giants.

Ivory Coast will take on Guinea-Bissau in the tournament’s opening game at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium on Saturday (today).
The tournament hosts are favourites to top Group A, while the Djurtus seek group-stage progress for the first time.
The pressure is on Jean-Louis Gasset’s Elephants when they take to the field on Saturday as AFCON 2023 commences, keen to impose themselves against Guinea-Bissau.
The West African side partook in qualifying despite being assured of a spot at the finals, finishing second after ending level with Zambia on 13 points, winning four of their six games (one loss).
Ivory Coast have group-stage history on their side, having progressed from that phase in eight of the previous nine times they have played at the Cup of Nations, and they seek to boost their prospects of making it nine in 10 with a strong showing against Guinea-Bissau.
Gasset’s troops wiped the floor with Sierra Leone in their tune-up game, claiming a 5-1 victory over the Leone Stars last weekend, as they impressed with their decisive execution in the final third.
Carrying that form into Saturday’s AFCON opener with the expectant home support is anyone’s guess, but their goalscoring form at least gives the Elephants reason to be optimistic in the lead-up to facing Guinea-Bissau.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/13000001/AFRICAN-STARS.jpg

Braga also has a perfect pro career, winning all six of her fights and although she has never won any by knockouts, the 33-year-old is a threat in the ring. She is ranked number two in Italy and 24 in the world among featherweights.      
Speaking to Saturday PUNCH ahead of the bout, Oshoba said, “Tomorrow is the show time and I am feeling good right now, feeling very good.

On Friday, Sadiq Umar was ruled out of the 2023 African Cup of Nations and replaced by Paul Onuachu. This is coming after striker Victor Boniface was replaced by Terem Moffi for the competition which is scheduled to start on Saturday (today) in Ivory Coast.
Umar picked up a knee injury in Nigeria’s 2-0 friendly defeat to the Syli Stars of Guinea on Monday and in a Friday statement posted on X by the official Super Eagles account, it was announced that Onuachu will replace the 26-year-old.
“Sadiq Umar is out of the AFCON 2023 squad due to injury and Paul Onuachu replaces him,” they wrote.  Related News  AFCON: Peseiro dismisses concerns Super Eagles are top-heavy  AFCON 2023: Awoniyi backs Super Eagles to win  AFCON 2023: Osimhen carries weight of injury-hit Nigeria   
Onuachu was at the AFCON 2019 finals in Egypt. However, due to an injury, the 29-year-old missed the previous edition of the competition in Cameroon. In 15 games for Trabzonspor this season, the forward has scored nine goals and three assists.
The former Enyimba forward, who won two African Champions League winners, said that the replacements were good strikers and the wingers just needed to provide better chances.
“I don’t think there is a crisis, because the other guys they have called up are good strikers as well. It is just that the Super Eagles have not keyed into someone like Onuachu’s potential, he has a good height, and most of his goals are with his head, but anytime he plays with the Super Eagles, wide players like (Samuel) Chukwueze and Moses Simon fail to bring the crosses for him.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12235548/VICTOR-EZEJI.jpg

The winner over the two legs will qualify as one of Africa’s four flag-bearers at this year’s U-20 Women’s World Cup finals in Colombia which has been scheduled for August 30 to September 22.

sports,AFCON 2023 begins!,"The 2023 Africa Cup of Nations kicks off today with a tricky tie between Ivory Coast and Guniea-Bissau. The 34th edition of the tournament is considered one of the most wide-open in recent times, with...",13th January 2024,https://punchng.com/afcon-2023-begins/,Peter Akinbo,"The 2023 Africa Cup of Nations kicks off today with a tricky tie between Ivory Coast and Guniea-Bissau. The 34th edition of the tournament is considered one of the most wide-open in recent times, with several teams capable of lifting the title on February 11.
An important element to note is that the tournament has always been unpredictable. Below is the breakdown of every AFCON 2023 group and what we should expect.
Group A – Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau
This group is straightforward on paper. Ivory Coast -the host nation – and Nigeria have better players than the other two nations, so, most would fancy both to easily progress to the knockout stages.


  
The Elephants are hosting the event for the second time and are looking for their third continental title. They last won it in 2015 at the tail end of their Golden Generation. They have a young squad led by the experienced Max Gradel, who was part of the 2015 title-winning team. The likes of Sebastien Haller, Nicolas Pepe, Ibrahim Snagare, and Franck Kessie should make qualification easy for the hosts.
Meanwhile, Nigeria have been accused many times for underachieving at the tournament. They have reigning African Player of the Year Victor Osimhen in their strike force, so they are expected to get through. They are making their 20th AFCON appearance, per CAF.
Equatorial Guinea finished fourth in 2015, so they could be a problem for the two fancied nations. They have exciting players who play across Europe.      
Guinea-Bissau will be playing in their fourth AFCON tournament and they will face the hosts in the opening game, which is daunting. Their clash with Equatorial Guinea will be huge if they both lose to the West African giants.
Group B – Egypt, Ghana, Cape Verde, Mozambique
No country has won more AFCON trophies (7) than Egypt. With Mohamed Salah, they always have a chance, and that was evident in the 2021 edition where they reached the final.
Pressure will be on Ghana to end their 42-year drought this year again. This time around, they have an in-form Mohammed Kudus and Atheltic Bilbao striker, Inaki Williams to rely on. Ghana and Egypt are favourites to progress from this group.
Cape Verde have reached the quarter-final before and are playing in their second straight tournament. They will look to winger, Ryan Mendes to give them inspiration.
This will be the first tournament for Mozambique since 2010 and they will be hoping for good performances in a tough AFCON group.
Group C – Senegal, Cameroon, Guinea, Gambia        
This group has two giants and former winners of the tournament, Senegal and Cameroon. Senegal are the defending champion and are still one of the best teams on the continent.
Cameroon have always made their mark at AFCON and although their squad isn’t as great as it was a few years ago, they are always competitive. Therefore, Senegal and Cameroon should get through comfortably. However, Guinea might be a problem for them.  Related News  [PICTORIAL] AFCON: Beautiful scenes ahead of opening match  AFCON: Ivory Coast vs Guinea Bissau (PREVIEW)  AFCON: Make Nigeria proud, ex-Ebonyi sports commissioner urges Super Eagles   
Guinea finished second in 1976 and have been a regular at the tournament. They will be looking for inspiration from one of the hottest strikers in the world – Serhou Guirassy who has scored 17 goals in 14 Bundesliga games this season.
The Gambia made their AFCON debut in 2021 and reached the quarter-finals and are certainly not pushovers.
Group D – Algeria, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Angola
Algeria, 2019 champions, are still one of the best teams on the continent and will be looking to right the wrongs of the 2021 edition, where they didn’t get past the group stage.
Burkina Faso have been consistent in the last few years. They finished second in 2013 and third in 2017. They also finished fourth in the 2021 tournament and will surely be a contender to progress from this group. Their squad consists of players like Edmond Tapsoba and Bertrand Traore.      
Angola have reached the quarter-final before and a a serious candidate to progress from this group. Meanwhile, Mauritania only made their AFCON debut in 2019 and will face an uphill task when they face the other teams in this group.
Group E – Tunisia, South Africa, Namibia, Mali
This is a tough group where three teams, Tunisia, South Africa, and Mali all have a chance of progressing. Tunisia are one of the most consistent teams on the continent and have made it out for the group stages many times this century. They eliminated Nigeria in the last tournament.
Since winning the tournament in 1996, South Africa have failed to impress. However, they are coached by 2017 AFCON winner with Cameroon, Hugo Broos, and expectations are high.
Mali are another West African team that has always threatened. They have qualified for every AFCON tournament since 2008. They reached the last 16 in the last two tournaments.
Namibia are making their fourth appearance and are yet to win a match, so things will be tough for them, and the group will likely be fought between the three other teams.
Group F – Morocco, DR Congo, Zambia, Tanzania  
Many expect Morocco to go all the way in this tournament, and they couldn’t have asked for a better group. They are the top-ranked team in Africa, and anything less than a final will be a disappointment.
DR Congo and Zambia have won the tournament before, but their squads are much different now. Zambia won it in 2012 and are in their first AFCON appearance since 2015. DR Congo’s title came in the 1970s, and they even missed out on the 2021 edition. These two sides will probably fight for the second spot.
Tanzania are playing their third AFCON tournament and would be overachiever if they make it out of the group stage.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/13000308/AFCON-BEGINS.jpg

“He is a player who has a lot of speed, has a strong left foot and can be used in various positions,” said Dortmund sporting director Sebastien Kehl.      
Runners-up on goal difference last season, Dortmund are currently fifth on the table and sit six points away from automatic Champions League qualification.

rom winning the AFCON to reaching the round of 16 of the World Cup in 1994 and even achieving Nigeria’s highest FIFA ranking (No.5), what was the secret of the 1994 Super Eagles?
I don’t think there was any secret other than the hard work that we put into the team. And you will recall that the team started building from 1990, and the outcome of all the build-up from the 1990 Nations Cup — although I wasn’t invited into the team until August 1990 — is what everybody saw. My first game was against Togo and I think that was a qualifier for AFCON 1992. We went to the Nations Cup in 1992 and we did our best to win bronze in Senegal. Later we continued to prepare for 1994 and the team was looking so good.
What was the preparations and team spirit for the 1994 AFCON like?


  
First of all, there were so many invited players at different points. Some would come and some would go, and all that. So, it was simply down to everyone to put in their best and I could say we had a bunch of players that were ready to sacrifice and wanted to make a name. And you know Nigeria had never qualified for the World Cup before then as well, so, winning the Nations Cup in 1994 was another priority and we were able to achieve both.
Were you afraid of not making the team due to the array of stars available then?
I was not afraid. When you work with passion and put all your best into something, there is no room for fear. Although it happens sometimes that one would do everything and put in their best into something and another thing happens, but I was not afraid. I was just hoping and working. I knew I did my best at the AFCON ’92, including playing in so many positions for the team and all of that.      
What was the impact of coach Clemens Westerhof in the team’s success?
A lot of impact. Westerhof knew everyone from head to toe, from our clubs to the national team and he was a kind of coach that was very vocal and was influential, even among the administrators. Westerhof told people what he wanted and went in to get whatever he wanted and it was good for the team as we got everything we wanted.
It’s been 11 years since our last AFCON win in 2013 and the current team has the mantra of winning it again. What can they learn from the 1994 set?  Related News  [PICTORIAL] AFCON: Beautiful scenes ahead of opening match  AFCON: Ivory Coast vs Guinea Bissau (PREVIEW)  AFCON: Peseiro dismisses concerns Super Eagles are top-heavy   
I don’t think any of them knew what happened and even knew most of the players (in 1994). I don’t know what they must have seen or learnt before now. But what I can say is that it is not enough to have good players playing very well in their clubs. That is to say talent is not enough. First you need talent as a player because if you don’t have it, things will be difficult but there are a lot of other things that will complement it. One of the things is for the players and officials to have the same vision and think in the same direction. They must work towards achieving a common goal by helping one another with dedication and determination. It’s just about bringing everything it takes to succeed together. There must be no bad blood, everyone must know their strengths and limitations and be ready to help one another in the team.
From their preparations, including a defeat in the friendly against Guinea, how do you see their chances?
I know we can’t use a friendly game to condemn the team, so I think it will be a lesson to reassess the team and correct mistakes ahead of the AFCON. I believe we can do better at the AFCON and even other matches beyond the tournament. In terms of preparation, I think it’s almost the same for all countries because players need to come from their clubs before camping. With little time, it’s down to the coaches to do their assessments well. One friendly match might not be enough, but the time wasn’t really there as well. Regardless, we cannot dwell on any of these things as excuses, they have to correct all mistakes they have seen so far.
What was the feeling like when you scored your first AFCON goal for Nigeria?        
My first goal at the AFCON was in Senegal 1992 against Ghana in the semi-final. It was massive because Ghana are everlasting rivals and scoring against a team that had Tony Yeboah, Abedi Pele and other big players was huge. But unfortunately, the goal was not enough for us to qualify because they scored a second goal that prevented us from reaching the final.
Following the disappointment in 1992, how did you celebrate winning the AFCON eventually in 1994?
Personally, I was very happy that we won the Nations Cup but in hindsight, I still wished that I also played in that final, the more so that I even scored one of our goals against Gabon as we progressed in the tournament. I remember I came in as a substitute in the first game, I started the second match and came on as a substitute again up until the semi-finals. But I wasn’t dressed in the final. I would have loved to appear in the final but it was not to be so. But definitely, winning the AFCON is one of the greatest things and I was very happy to have won.
There were reports about mafia in the 1994 squad. How did that help or affect the team?
You know people will talk when you have big players and leaders in the team. I was young then but I was not new in the team, having been part of the side since 1990. I was more of an older player in the team but we had players that were older than us that we were looking up to. There was Stephen Keshi, Rashidi Yekini, Chidi Nwanu, Michael Emenalo and all that. Players like Sunday Oliseh, Austin Okocha, Daniel Amokachi and many others were also in the team. When people talk about mafia, maybe what they mean is when there are older players in the team and coaches also consult them because of the time they spent in the team, their personality and all that. But all the same, we had the same vision. Although not everybody would be friends, there was no bad blood in the team. We had players who would not agree with each other but that was on the surface. When we got to the field, you would see the passion. If that is what people call mafia, I wouldn’t know.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/06000733/Mutiu-Adepoju-2.jpg

The AFCON which kicks off on Saturday with a game between Nigeria’s Group A foes – hosts Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau – will hold till February 11.
Media officer of the team, Babafemi Raji, told our correspondent that both players were not part of the team’s second training session in Abidjan on Thursday. While Iheanacho was initially reported to have travelled with the team to Ivory Coast from Lagos on Wednesday, coach Jose Peseiro on Monday said the Leicester City forward was already in Abidjan, awaiting his teammates.
“Iheanacho will join us on Saturday and Moffi on Sunday,” Raji told PUNCH Sports Extra.


  
Meanwhile, Sadiq, who is in Abidjan, did not train with the rest of the squad on Thursday, as he jogged alone on the sidelines, while Peseiro and his crew worked with the remaining 22 of the final 25 men, with Moffi not yet with the squad as well.
Raji also allayed Sadiq’s injury fear as ‘precautionary’.  Related News  AFCON 2023: Osimhen carries weight of injury-hit Nigeria  Arsenal urged to sign Osimhen over Toney  Osimhen dreams of AFCON title   
Nigeria’s injury list has been growing since the Portuguese coach named his final 25-man squad.      
Leicester midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, was the first to be ruled out and was replaced by Antwerp’s Alhassan Yusuf, while red-hot Bayer Leverkusen man, Victor Boniface, also picked up a groin injury before the end of the team’s one-week training camp in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
Iheanacho’s involvement has been in doubt since he was named in the final 25-man squad, after Leicester coach Enzo Maresca announced he was nursing a muscle problem. But he hasn’t been replaced, unlike Ndidi and Boniface.
With the 27-year-old still doubtful and Sadiq half fit, Peseiro only has reigning African Player of The Year, Victor Osimhen, as the only fit striker.

The former West Bromwich Albion and Dynamo Kiev striker claimed that players in the team, who were born and raised abroad, were not passionate enough.
“They (players of overseas decent) don’t have the passion to play for Nigeria. I met some of them after we failed to qualify (for the 2022 World Cup) at the airport when I was returning to England,” he added.
“They left the country the following day after the defeat to Ghana. They didn’t care how they threw the country into sadness. The NFF must enforce discipline in the team.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/28002845/Brown-Ideye.jpg

The 23-year-old is currently sidelined until April, after undergoing surgery on his groin, which forced him out of Nigeria’s 2023 AFCON squad. He was in the final 25-man squad before picking up the knock at the team’s training camp in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
While he remains a major miss for the Supers Eagles in Ivory Coast, Leverkusen will also miss his services as they seek their first Bundesliga title.
The Nigerian, who was signed for €20m in the summer, is their highest goal scorer this season, netting 10 times and also providing 17 assists in 16 matches. He has also won four consecutive Bundesliga Rookie Player of The Month Award, while he is also in the run for a fifth accolade.

“Everybody knew him as a great player, he (Alonso) was fantastic and won everything in football. He’s really helped me a lot and tried to advise me,” Boniface said.
“He gave me the example of Didier Drogba, saying he was big and strong, and he wants the same from me. He was trying to put that type of mentality in my head because I’m the type of guy who just wants to have a good game. Even if I’m not scoring, it doesn’t matter, as long as we are winning. But he wants to try and change that mentality, for me to become a fighter. He’s a top, top coach.”      
On the Switzerland midfielder, Xhaka, whom their pictures on and off the pitch have suggested a good relationship between both of them, Boniface said, “He has experience, maturity and he’s a top professional.
“We have a young squad but with Granit, it feels like we’ve been playing for a long time because he talks to us and tries to help us,” he added.

The Gunners have been struggling to score goals for the last six weeks now and have also fallen off the pace of Liverpool in the Premier League title race, dropping to fourth in the table with a five-point gap separating both sides.
Mikel Arteta’s side have not been clinical enough in front of goal this season, having scored only 37 goals.
Brentford’s Ivan Toney, who is returning from an eight-month ban due to betting has been most strongly linked with a move to Arsenal, but the trio Shearer, Richards and Sylvestre believe the Gunners should turn their attention to the Nigerian striker, saying he is a more complete striker than the Englishman.


  
Speaking to GGRecon, Silvestre said, “Yes, I think he would be. In my eyes, Victor’s a more complete striker than Ivan Toney.
“I believe his style would be better suited to Arsenal too. As soon as Osimhen joined Napoli from Lille, he needed six months to adapt and then after that he became a real threat and scored a lot of goals,” Silvestre said.

Shearer also named the new African Player of The Year during The Rest Is Football podcast. He said, “Osimhen!” when Gary Lineker the kind of striker Arsenal needed most.
Former Manchester City defender Richards also added, “Osimhen would be my one for Arsenal.”
Osimhen’s recent contract renewal with Napoli ties him with the club till 2026, but it also signifies that he could be sold in the summer with a release clause between €120m and €130m. Italian media also reported that his salary has been doubled to €10m per season.
Arsenal’s London rivals, Chelsea are also said to be ready to break the bank to land the Nigerian in the summer, while the 25-year-old, according to TEAMtalk, is willing to sign a pre-agreement in January before making the switch to Chelsea officially at the end of the season.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/23143647/Victor-Osimhen.jpeg

The plane carrying the Gambia squad to the Africa Cup of Nations was forced to make an emergency landing after the oxygen supply failed.
The harrowing incident took place during the Gambia squad’s journey from Banjul to Abidjan which is a two-and-a-half-hour flight.
However, just nine minutes into the flight, several players experienced loss of consciousness, prompting the pilot to make an emergency landing back in Banjul. The oxygen supplies on board were running low, leading to severe headaches and extreme dizziness among those on the plane.

Really and truly. After nine minutes the pilot decided to return because there was no oxygen supply. Some players did not wake up [until] immediately after landing. We almost got carbon monoxide poisoning. Another half hour of flying and we would all have been dead.”
The Gambian Football Federation also released a statement which read, “The Gambia Football Federation (GFF) regrets to inform the general public that the Chartered Flight carrying the Scorpions to the African cup of Nations has returned to Banjul due to technical problems. The flight was nine minutes airborne when the crew realised and immediately requested to return to Banjul.

However, the technical team of the operating company of the flight, Air Cote d’Ivoire is further assessing the situation to establish what caused the lack of oxygen and cabin pressure. In this regard, the team, including the players and staff are now on their way to base at the Ocean Bay Hotel as they await further instructions. It is important to note that every member of the delegation is safe and in sound health.

At the handover of the projects on Tuesday, Adesomoju, who is also a former member of the university’s Governing Council, said giving back to one’s alma mater should become a regular practice in order to contribute to the growth of education in the country.
“My giving back is not a function of having enough but it is my passion to give and it is in tandem with my belief and spirit of giving back to humanity. I count this as a privilege to give back to the university that made me, the university that impacted on me quality leadership prowess.

December 27, 2023, would not be quickly erased from the memory of the residents and indigenes of Ondo State as a day of passing into glory of one of the prominent sons of the state and former state governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu.
Akeredolu, popularly called ‘Aketi’ by his political associates, passed away in Germany during a long battle with cancer. The illness had taken the late former governor to the European country for treatment for some months but unfortunately, he could not survive the battle.
After the bad news of the demise of the late state chief executive was broken to the people of the state, there was a series of condolence messages from people of all walks of life, right from President Bola Tinubu, the state governors, who were his colleagues, past governors, traditional rulers, members of the Nigeria Bar Association, political associates as well as friends and family of the deceased. 
In most of the condolence messages, the former governor of the state was described as a fearless man; he was also remembered for his candidness in approaching issues. Aketi (Akeredolu) was commended for his brave stance on the protection of lives and property of the people he governed during the time some criminal Fulani herdsmen began to launch attacks on the people of the South-West region some of whom were kidnapped, raped, and killed, while their farms were destroyed. As the Chairman of the South-West Governors’ Forum, Akeredolu championed the creation and effective operation of the South-Western Nigeria Security Network also known as Amotekun Corps in the face of high criticism from some quarters.
The son of the late governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu Jnr. while announcing the incident, described his late father as courageous, and compassionate, saying the late Aketi would be greatly missed.
Part of his tribute read, “He peacefully departed in his sleep at a hospital in Germany, where he was undergoing treatment for protracted prostate cancer. While we are deeply saddened and devastated by his departure, we find solace in the understanding that as he transitions to eternity, he will be guided by the benevolent hands of the angels of light, with whom he resided during his remarkable and fruitful journey on earth.      
“During this challenging time, we sincerely appreciate everyone who has stood by us and extended their support since the news broke. We humbly request your prayers and support, while also asking for privacy as we navigate through this trying period. Daddy, may you rest in perfect peace.”
Also, having officially announced the death of the former governor, the government of the Sunshine State declared three days of mourning to honour the departed governor while condolence registers were opened at the Governor’s Office in Akure, the state capital. It was also learnt that the same was done at his private residence in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, as well as the Akeredolu’s private residence in Owo his hometown.
The incumbent governor and former deputy and acting governor, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, who was sworn in shortly after the demise of his former boss, declared that the name of the late governor would be immortalised. All these are testimony that the late Akeredolu was a good man during his lifetime.
However, some observations have been made in the aftermath of the death of the former Chairman of the Southern Governors’ Forum. During a visit to the community, it was observed that only a few residents were part of the mourning as the atmosphere never depicted that a big shot from the ancient town of Owo, where he (Akeredolu) hailed from had passed away. It was also learnt that it was only the first day that Akeredolu’s death was announced that a part of the community mourned. However, shortly after, social and business activities resumed as usual as if nothing tragic had befallen the ancient community.
Akeredolu’s residence was said to have few visitors during the prayer session organised by the family and friends of the deceased in his honour eight days after his demise. It was reported that Akeredolu’s family was represented by his younger sister, Toyin Akeredolu, at the prayer session.
Many believe that the Owo community is supposed to be a mecca for visitors from every part of the world if members of the immediate Akeredolu’s family had stayed in his private house in Owo, but they were in Jericho GRA, Ibadan, attending to visitors.
However, since there is nobody to receive visitors at Akeredolu’s Owo residence, sympathisers and dignitaries were said to have been thronging the palace of Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Ogunoye, to condole with him and the people of Owo over the death of one of his prominent subjects.        
A source in the palace said some of the dignitaries that visited the traditional ruler include the incumbent state governor, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, who led members of the Ondo State Executive Council to condole with the first-class monarch; a former governor of the state, Dr Olusegun Mimiko; the senator representing Ondo North Senatorial Distribution, Jide Ipinsagba; and the members of Ondo State Council of Obas led by the Olubaka of Okaland, Oba Yusuf Adeleye. The Oka Akoko monarch was said to have represented the chairman of the council and Deji of Akure, Oba Aladelusi Aladetoyinbo.
In his condolence message, issued through his media assistant, Sam Adewale, the Olowo of Owo Oba Ogunoye, described the demise of the former governor as tragic, sad, and painful, adding that the death of the former governor was an irredeemable loss to the government and people of Ondo State, family, and the entire Owo kingdom. The monarch submitted that death was inevitable as nobody could challenge God whenever it was time to die.
“This is too much to comprehend. The death of Aketi is an unfortunate occurrence that came to the entire kingdom as a rude shock. May the Almighty God grant eternal bliss to his precious soul,” the traditional ruler prayed.
Given the ugly development, there have been divergent views of the people of the ancient town over the absence of Akeredolu’s family in Owo during the mourning period. Some agreed that there was nothing wrong if the family stayed back in their base in the Oyo State capital receiving sympathisers, while some were of the view that it did not speak well of the Akeredolu’s family to abandon their hometown and state to be attending to visitors outside the state, considering the status of the deceased in Owo and the state in general, when he was alive.
It could also be recalled that the Akeredolu’s family and aides were highly criticised by the opposition party and some concerned citizens of the state for allegedly keeping the ailing governor in Ibadan after he returned to Nigeria from Germany in September, while he was reportedly recuperating. After the transition, the family allegedly failed to return to his Owo country home to mourn.
A resident, Mr Kenny Daramola, said the family had the right to choose wherever was convenient for them to host their visitors, maintaining that they didn’t need to be in Owo or Ondo State.
He said, “We don’t have people coming here, even people here have gone to pay condolence visits to the family in Ibadan. This is because, you know, Aketi (Akeredolu) was an Ibadan-based person. He spent most of his life in Ibadan; he had his business in Ibadan, and his family is in Ibadan. So, I think the family feels comfortable being in Ibadan to receive sympathisers.”      
However, another resident, Kasim Alaba, frowned on the development as he said that Akeredolu’s family had not displayed the attitude of a proper Owo indigene in their decision to stay outside the state to receive visitors. At the same time, the late governor had a private house in Owo.
“For me, I don’t think it is proper for the family of late Akeredolu to be mourning in Ibadan. Although we know that Aketi was based and making his living in Ibadan before coming to be governor in Ondo State, Ibadan is not their home. They are not indigenes of Oyo State. We should also not forget that this man died on the throne as a serving governor. So, his family should have honoured him by coming home to Owo to mourn. Akeredolu is an original Owo indigene and made an impact in the community and Ondo State as a whole; he deserves our respect,” he opined.
A community leader in Owoland, Alhaji Abimbola Omolola, expressed the importance of the bereaved Akeredolu’s family being in Owo during the mourning period, even as he expressed optimism that the former governor’s family would still come to their hometown.
He said, “They (family) will still move from Ibadan and come home. Home is the last place for everyone and there is no place like home, East or West, North or South, home is the best. They may have their reason for staying in Ibadan for now, but I believe they will move back to this place when all the arrangements for the burial are completed by the government and the family. It’s a state burial; I know the government is going to set up a committee to handle the burial ceremony, but the family will be involved. Before then, they would have moved to Owo and made sure all arrangements were completed.
Omolola, who described the death of Akeredolu as a great loss to the Owo community, said the late former governor deserved a befitting burial and honour from all the stakeholders in the state, noting that it might take a long time before the community would have the opportunity to produce another governor for the state.
“It is a great loss, not only to his family, not only to Owo town, not only to the surrounding towns but to the entire Owo kingdom as a whole because before another governor can rise from Owo area again, it may take another 40 years. This is because the former governor, the late Adekunle Ajasin, was there from 1979-1983, and the rotation has just come back to us. After Ajasin, the mantle of leadership went to the South Senatorial District. It left the South and went to the Central. Then, from Central, it went to the North (Adebayo Adefarati). (Olusegun) Agagu was there for some time, and (Olusegun) Mimiko too was there. So, it was another 40 years before it came back to us.
“So, we should not envisage that we are expecting another governor from this area till another 40 years. So, it is a great loss to us. The fact is that he did not complete his term. But during his tenure, he worked not only for Owo; he worked for the state and South-West as a whole. As far as security is concerned, he was the brain behind Amotekun, and Amotekun has performed excellently well. They have relieved us from the herdsmen, from kidnappers, from other criminals.  
“Also, he has impacted all the 18 local government areas in the state with regards to infrastructural development. And as far as education is concerned, he has been able to increase the budgetary position of education. So, not only Akeredolu’s family or Owo is mourning, but the whole state should also mourn,” the community leader stressed.
Meanwhile, as of the time of filing this report, the official statement on the burial arrangement of the deceased has not been released by either the family or the state government. It was, however, gathered that the government was planning to set up a committee on the burial. Similarly, a source close to Akeredolu’s family disclosed that the late former governor would be interred in Owo, his hometown.
“The arrangement is going on underground for the burial, but Akeredolu will certainly be buried in Owo. Even the Anglican Church in Owo is making arrangements; maybe to bury him beside the late former governor, Adekunle Ajasin, within the church premises in Owo,” the source stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12193855/AKEREDOLU.jpg

It said it avoided basing the foreign exchange benchmark in the 2024 budget on a spot rate, to avoid eventualities and uncertainties.
The Minister of Budget and National Planning, Atiku Bagudu, who spoke with State House correspondents explained that the FG had earlier chosen the projected exchange rate of N750 to the dollar in the 2024 budget which the National Assembly raised to N800 to the dollar,
Bagudu said, “For budgeting purposes, you don’t use the spot rate of anything. Oil prices can go to 120 today, maybe there is a shortage, or maybe there is a collision between two ships that will block a channel. 
“It would be foolish to use that as a reference price, I should take a period maybe six months to one year and say let me observe this average behaviour, so you don’t use spot prices. So even with the exchange rate, it is like that.”
He explained further, “Much as we are hoping that it would soon come below, but at the time you are doing the budget, you will take a view on average performance. And that’s what we took.
“We took an average performance of N750 on the executive side and we proposed it to the National Assembly.”      
The minister also said that Tinubu regarded the National Assembly’s decision to raise the rate further considering his respect for institutions and democracy.
“So, he respected democracy that even though it was higher than what he submitted, but the institution that says so has the authority to say so and even at the time they say 100 because it’s not an official rate it’s tidal because, with the deregulated market, you no longer have an official rate, it is much lower than even the way the markets are bidding,” the minister said.

The minister noted that the FG is positive that its current measures would soon yield a significant increase in the supply of foreign exchange in the economy.
Bagudu also spoke on the level of borrowing to fund the deficit in the 2024 budget, saying there is a significant difference between 2024 borrowing compared to last year’s.
“In 2023, the budget anticipated a borrowing of close to N14tn. This year’s budget is N9.1 trillion. So we think that is significant.
“Because it’s 2023 took us to about 6.11 per cent of our GDP as borrowing. This one is3.8 per cent. So the quantum had decreased,” Bagudu added.
The former Kebbi State Governor said the FG will operate strictly within the dictates of fiscal responsibility law in the new year, which provides for the Central Bank of Nigeria to lend to the government through its Ways and Means window, only 5 per cent of the total budget.        
He explained, “We will not go outside the law and borrow from ways and means, what is outside the law. So the fiscal responsibility law says, that every year, the central bank can lend the government up to 5 per cent of its budget for the year.
“So if you go out of that, you’re going outside the lawful limit, and that’s what the minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy was very clear we are not going to do. We are not going to resort to borrowing outside the law.
“And secondly, as much as possible, we will even borrow away from the central bank because sometimes it’s even cheaper to borrow. So, those are the two elements. So the quantum has decreased, then we will go by the book.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/11224051/Atiku-Bagudu.jpg

“I told him today, I am committing to play my part to support your administration, and I have no apologies to anybody,” Bwala told State House correspondents after closed-door talks with the President at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja.
“APC is a party. President Bola Tinubu is my motivation; if supporting him will take me to APC, so be it,” he stated when asked if he would defect to the APC.
On January 2, 2024, Bwala, a staunch critic of the governing APC and the Tinubu administration, said opposition political parties must form a strong coalition if they would successfully wrestle power from the governing APC in the 2027 general elections. 
Bwala, a guest on Channels Television’s Politics Today, said that without a coalition of opposition parties, President Tinubu would spend eight years in office.
“Without a coalition of political parties, Tinubu is going to spend the next eight years. That one is for sure.
“The truth of the matter is that there will be a coalition of political parties that will be very strong. This is a fact that I know.        Related News  Tinubu sets up panel to audit social investment programmes  Rivers crisis: I've fulfilled my part of peace deal - Wike  Join me in developing Kano, governor woos APC candidate   
“The coalition that is coming will swallow some of the elements that are creating the problems in the various political parties,” he said.
He commended the President’s suspension of the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Dr Betta Edu, saying, “Some of his (Tinubu’s) Ministers that were allegedly reported to have committed infractions, instead of protecting them, he asked that the law should have its course and suspended somebody without wasting time. That, to me, is impressive because it’s about the people.”
Referring to Tuesday’s announcement of a 60 per cent slash in travel entourages for the Presidency and MDAs, Bwala remarked, “There has been this outcry that the government is bloated. Yesterday, he introduced a policy that reduced the cost of governance and today, he told me it is just the beginning.”
The legal practitioner said the President assured him that more cost-cutting measures are underway to reduce the cost of governance.
“What have we been talking about as citizens is that if you don’t have a personal grudge against someone…if it is a policy issue.
“What I’m saying apart from today that I’m talking here is that you all need to visit my Twitter page. In the last few days, I have been expressing my surprise and appreciation to the President for the decisions he is making. So, this is not about political party. And you need to know that, like I said, I was with him before I left. And I was doggedly committed to him.
“I told him today that I am committing to play my part to support your administration, and I have no apologies to anybody,” he explained.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02170946/pjimage.jpg

This was just a...",8th January 2024,https://punchng.com/betta-edu-deal-with-cartel-members-replacing-cabal-ndume-tells-tinubu/,Tope Omogbolagun,"The Chief Whip of the Senate, Ali Ndume, on Monday, commended President Bola Tinubu for suspending the embattled Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Dr Betta Edu.
This was just as he said Tinubu’s suspension of Edu was a timely action.
He also advised the President to immediately curtail the excesses of what it called an emerging political cartel and warned that it may be worse than a cabal if unchecked.
The President had earlier suspended Edu after coming under attack over a leaked memo on December 20, 2023, which revealed that she directed the Accountant-General of the Federation, Oluwatoyin Madein, to transfer N585m to a private account owned by one Oniyelu Bridget, who the ministry claimed currently serves as the Project Accountant, Grants for Vulnerable Groups. 
In a telephone conversation on Monday, Ndume said the alleged fraud committed by the suspended Minister may not be isolated.
He warned that if unchecked, the emerging political cartel may destabilise the administration of the President.
The Borno South senator maintained that for Tinubu to succeed and deliver on his Renewed Hope Agenda, some tough decisions must be taken and some elements curtailed within the administration.      
He said the prompt suspension of Edu is a confirmation that Tinubu is serious about tackling corruption and eliminating waste within the administration.
Ndume said the move will restore confidence in his government and Nigerians will begin to take his administration seriously.
He said, “What President Tinubu has done is very timely. The suspension of the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs is a welcome development. It will allow the relevant agencies to conduct a proper investigation.
“Some people in the same position Tinubu is would not have acted. But as a leader who is in charge, he acted swiftly and the minister has been suspended. We should commend the President. This is something Nigerians should commend.”
He, however, added, “But the President should not stop there. There is an emerging political cartel within the corridors of power. The President must act swiftly and dismantle the cartel.  Related News  Tinubu sets up panel to audit social investment programmes  Rivers crisis: I've fulfilled my part of peace deal - Wike  Join me in developing Kano, governor woos APC candidate   
“If they’re not stopped, they’ll be stronger and worse than the cabal. The President must not allow that to happen. I don’t think what the minister did was an isolated case. I don’t think she acted alone.
“The President needs to look deep and flush out those involved in mismanaging the funds meant for humanitarian assistance. We’re hopeful that the President will take more decisive actions in the future.”        
Meanwhile, Ndume has called on Tinubu to revisit the issue of motivation of security agents in the country, especially members of the Armed Forces.
He said the President needed to equip, empower and motivate security agents to enable them to carry out their responsibilities decisively.
The Senate Chief Whip said soldiers and other members of the Armed Forces fighting insurgency are not well-equipped, motivated or empowered to fight the war adequately.
He argued that the salaries and other allowances they were paid were grossly insufficient to motivate them to win the war.
Ndume said since Tinubu has openly told heads of security agencies that he will not accept failure, he needs to revisit the welfare of men and officers tackling insecurity across the country, especially in the North East.
He noted, “President Tinubu has made it clear that he won’t accept excuses from heads of security agencies. And I agree with him. We need to win this war. But we need to do more. Those soldiers and other members of the Armed Forces fighting to protect the country are not properly motivated.
“I’m urging the President to do more and revisit these issues I’ve listed-equip them; motivate them; and revisit their salaries and allowances.      
“This move will go a long way in changing the tide of war in favour of the government. But currently, what they’re getting is too small to even take care of their daily needs in the field while fighting.
“I’m optimistic that if the right things are done, we’ll see a different outcome in the ongoing insurgency war in various parts of the country. Let’s equip and motivate them and we’ll see drastic changes.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10155249/Ali-Ndume.jpg

He called on the Fe...",8th January 2024,https://punchng.com/navy-not-private-firms-should-protect-oil-pipelines-diri/,Daniels Igoni,"The Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, has criticised the Federal Government’s maritime protection policy of engaging non-state actors to secure the maritime environment.
He called on the Federal Government to review the security strategy, saying it was a policy decision the government would later regret to have adopted in its effort to secure economic assets in the nation’s territorial domain.
Diri stated this during a courtesy visit to him by the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Emmanuel Ogalla, at Government House in Yenagoa, on Monday.
The PUNCH reports that the Nigerian Navy authorities had engaged in a frequent war of words with the management of Tantita Security Services Limited, a private security outfit belonging to a former militant leader in the Niger Delta, Mr Government Ekpemupolo, also known as Tompolo, over security operations around the country’s oil assets since the Federal Government awarded a multi-billion naira pipeline surveillance contract to the firm. 
Diri expressed concerns that the continued use of such unconventional security agents might cause greater security challenges shortly, and called for the strengthening of the Nigerian Navy to perform its constitutional responsibility.
The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, contended that private individuals and groups should not be allowed to execute oil pipeline surveillance and protection contracts independent of the supervision of conventional security agencies.
He pointed out in a statement issued by the deputy governor’s media aide, Mr Doubara Atasi, that safeguarding the nation’s territorial waters was the exclusive preserve of the Navy and should be supported in every way possible to enable it to effectively secure oil and other critical national assets in coastal communities.      
He noted that “already, there had been reported cases of violation of human rights and security breaches by surveillance contractors in local communities around the state.”
Diri said, “The cry of the Bayelsa State Government is that non-state actors are not the best to protect our oil assets. In the name of oil pipeline protection contracts, most of them violate the rights of our people in our localities.
“Let us not do things that we will regret as a country tomorrow. What the Federal Government is doing right now is like cutting the nose to spice the face.  Related News  Non-state actors shouldn’t be involved in pipeline protection – Diri  Navy not working against firms protecting pipelines – Spokesman  Rivers crisis: Focus on development, Diri advises Fubara   
“You don’t need to cut off your head because you have rotten teeth. You simply look for a toothbrush. You will be surprised that we will get to a point where some of these non-state actors will start to challenge us.
“I will suggest that the Nigerian Navy should be allowed to play that role to protect our critical oil assets. The Federal Government should therefore rejig or reinvent its security strategy to securing these assets.”
However, he commended officers and men of the Nigerian Navy serving in Bayelsa for demonstrating professionalism in discharging their official duties, which he said had helped the state to remain one of the most peaceful states in the country.
While calling on the Navy to sustain the tempo, Diri suggested to the Chief of Naval Staff to give official recognition and rewards to the officers for their professional efficiency so far.        
Earlier in his remarks, the Chief of Naval Staff, Ogalla, said the Nigerian Navy could not do without Bayelsa State given the state’s strategic location and the critical oil and gas facilities it is hosting in the Niger Delta.
Ogalla, who described the recent electoral victory of the governor and his deputy as a true victory for the people of Bayelsa, appealed to the government and people of the state to sustain their goodwill towards the Navy for better services.
The naval boss particularly called on oil-bearing communities to see the Navy as a friend and to show cooperation in the provision of credible information to curb criminality in the state.
He said, “Bayelsa and Nigerians are partners because Bayelsa is in the core of the Niger Delta. Bayelsa holds a lot of resources in oil and gas, and the protection of these assets is a key role of the Navy. The Navy must create an enabling environment for the oil companies to produce their maximum output, and there has been significant improvement so far in the last six months.
“This is possible with the cooperation of the Bayelsa State Government and the people; the Bayelsa State Government has also provided resources to the Navy. So we have a cordial relationship with the oil-producing communities, and we need more cooperation in intelligence and information to curb criminality around the facilities.”
The Chief of Naval Staff was accompanied on the visit by several top-ranking naval officers, including the Flag Officer Commanding, Central Naval Command, Rear Admiral S.J, Bura, and the Commander of NNS Soroh, Commodore A.O. Ojebode.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/31190019/Duoye-Diri.jpg

He was accused of illegally receiving money from a former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, from the funds meant for arms procurement 
He was jailed for two years but the judge placed an option of a fine of N13m, which he took and avoided time in prison.

Nwoye, while announcing the modalities for the distribution of the items, on Monday, said the essence was not for a political campaign, but a way of giving back to society, adding that people from outside the district would also benefit. 

He also added that the gesture was part of his resolve to empower his people to reduce crime and unemployment in the senatorial district and beyond.

What are the factors behind the current problem in the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party as it seems there are three factions?
It looks like there are three factions in the state but the problem did not start today. When Governor Godwin Obaseki was having a problem getting a second-term ticket in the All Progressives Congress, then he decided to move to the PDP. Most of the APC leaders and their supporters moved with the governor and worked with those we met there to give him victory. After the win, the governor turned against the old members and the ones who followed him to the PDP. He didn’t pick up calls and those of us who had board appointments lost them. So, there was bitterness between him and leaders from both sides. The governor’s inability to handle situations well led to his fallout with Dan Orbih and his group. Orbih is not a man you can just push around; he is a passionate politician who has a large following. The governor failed to unite us and that is why we are where we are today.
What should be done to unite the factions as the gulf seems to be getting wider, even as the primaries draw near? 
I know that some leaders met last week. Some even went to Orbih’s village to celebrate with him and many aspirants were also there. What is happening now is that leaders from different factions are coming together under Orbih and that will be bad for Obaseki who might be overwhelmed. I hope the factions will be a thing of the past before the primaries.
You have been quoted to have said the party must pick the right candidate to win the election. What should the right candidate look like?
I am hoping that the party will listen to the electorate, that is, all of us who are members, and make the right decision. We have a lot of problems in the state. We have schools that are not functional, and roads that have not been rehabilitated while we also have several other complaints from the people. The party should be able to nominate a candidate that can unite all the factions so that we will be able to win the election. We need someone who has been tested and is well known. The party should not impose someone who can’t relate with his people and speak his language. A former governor of the state, Comrade Adam Oshiomhole, brought Obaseki and left all the good candidates. That is the same thing the present governor is trying to do and that will not work.      
Don’t you think governance is beyond speaking your language but needs competence and your ability to deliver using your connections?
How is Obaseki going to convince people to vote for the candidate he has been taking around to meet party leaders? Are they not the people who are going to vote? Let’s accept that language should not be a barrier but all the candidates also have connections to do the job. Oshiomhole brought Obaseki because of his international connections but how well has it helped the state?
How does throwing the ticket open by the major political parties affect Edo Central’s clamour to produce the next governor?
The attention is still going to be on Edo Central despite the parties throwing their tickets open. Leaders in Edo South and Edo North are sympathetic to the call for Edo Central to produce the next governor. The South and Central have produced governors and I am sure they will back a candidate from Edo Central.
Don’t you think your preference for Anslem Ojezua will put you at loggerheads with other aspirants?
I have the right to choose who I want to queue behind. If I am with someone, I let everyone know that I am with that person. Some don’t show their support openly because they are afraid that if their candidate loses, they may be persecuted. That doesn’t bother me at all, I love Ojezua and I will support him. Before now, I had stepped aside but the moment Ojezua joined the race, I had to come back to support him. However, God is the one that will determine the winner of this race.
What do you make of the previous move by Governor Obaseki to bring unity into the party by organising meetings of members?        
The move he is making will not succeed. The leaders say that the governor has not done well and whoever he brings will have a problem.
Don’t you think the governor has a right to back a candidate like you are doing for Ojezua?  Related News  S'Court verdict: Don't lose hope, Lagos PDP urges members  It will be difficult to dislodge APC in 2027, declares PDP  Edo central PDP stakeholders shun Shaibu, endorse Ighodalo   
He has the right to support who he wants, but he has to be very careful. We can all see what is going on in Rivers State. If he is looking for somebody who will be loyal, that person should be Ojezua who has been with him all along. Ojezua’s activities were what enabled him to get the PDP ticket for his second term before winning the election. Ojezua has also made sacrifices for Obaseki.
How do you rate PDP’s chances in this election?
The PDP has a good chance of winning if we can work out our differences. Edo State is predominantly a PDP state. But with the way Governor Obaseki has handled matters relating to the party, it may be not easy. The PDP lost in Esanland (where the late Tony Anenih came from) in the last election because of disagreement over the choice of candidates.
Have you been invited to meet Obaseki’s candidate with other leaders?
They will not come to me or call me to any meeting because they know my stand. I don’t know of any party leader who has attended such a meeting, maybe they attended without letting me know so that they won’t be accused of collecting money. I will tell you that politics now is not all about money. The APC was said to have brought huge cash when Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu contested against Obaseki but people collected the money and voted against the APC. So, goodwill has a lot to do in an election. When Ambrose Alli ran for governor, he didn’t have money but he defeated his wealthy opponent. He had goodwill and people voted for him. People will take your money and still vote against you. So, if anyone believes he can buy the leaders with money, they will take it and still vote their conscience.      
Are you saying you will vote against your party if you feel the right person is not chosen?
I may just stay away from voting if the right person is not chosen and I am sure many will follow me. There will even be protest votes.
Will protest votes not mean working against your party?
The party would be working against itself by nominating the wrong candidate.
Why is the peace brokered by the National Working Committee of the party not yielding fruit and what do you foresee?
It may lead to failure even before the race starts if the Obaseki and Orbih factions do not agree. The disagreement will centre on the choice of governorship candidate by Obaseki. The governor has the right to choose anyone but that does not guarantee his nomination. If the governor’s choice is not wanted by other factions, he has to retrace his steps. There are lots of good aspirants out there; so, why that man?
What’s your take on the fact that the man said he is nobody’s candidate?  
Imagine him saying that when there are reports that Obaseki has taken him to see political leaders in the state. So whose candidate is he? They must think that we are fools. Why is Obaseki not taking other candidates to see party leaders?
What do you mean when you said the governor abandoned you after winning in 2020 and what were expecting him to do for you?
When I say abandoned, people may think it is about money, but it is not so. This is like having a son, and he helps you on the farm after you prevailed on him and you don’t thank him for the good job he has done, or even acknowledge his presence after coming back from the farm. I don’t care about money from politics; I have my business and it is doing well. I am in politics to help develop my community and give people jobs, and that is what he promised while campaigning. He abandoned us by not fulfilling his campaign promise to my community. I am representing a people and I need to do everything within my reach to make sure they are okay just like I did during the Yuletide. Imagine the government bringing 15 bags of rice to over 10,000 people.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06211321/Mathew-Emiohe.jpg

you recently called on President Bola Tinubu to return Nigeria to true federalism. Do you think the president can succeed in an area that his predecessors failed to address?
First, let me set the facts right. I never called for true federalism. There is nothing like that. Federalism is federalism, and there is no qualification for it. That is why federalism in France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, and the United States is practised differently. Federalism is a system of government that recognises the differences in a given state where you have a heterogeneous community of people with diverse cultures, religions, traditions, etc. In that diversity, they meet at the centre on agreed terms, and articles of faith; each different unit will have its constitution and they have that of the central government. It is the component unit that allocates powers to the central government and not the other way around. That was what we had in Nigeria during the First Republic.
It was the military that violently overtook the Tafawa Balewa government, abrogated the negotiated federal constitution, and substituted it with their military decrees which centralised Nigeria from then till date. As to whether President Bola Tinubu will succeed in this regard or not, there is a wide difference between Bola Tinubu and his predecessors. He was part of the core leadership of the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, and he spent his fortune and connection towards the restoration of democracy and the revalidation of the annulled victory of the (June 12) president-elect, Bashorun MKO Abiola. So, President Bola Tinubu knew and still knows what we are fighting for. 
Are you saying it is a must for the President to return Nigeria to the federal system?
I believe that President Bola Tinubu has an abiding duty to make the return of Nigeria to federalism a reality because he was part of us when we were fighting for democracy which led to the realisation of the Fourth Republic. That fight didn’t come on a silver platter; we lost our sweat, blood, possessions, and freedom. Some people were forced to go on self-exile and some were battered. Again, in the All Progressives Congress manifesto, it was stated that if the political party was elected into government, it would return Nigeria to federal constitutional governance and that was the promise upon which the party was voted into office.
When we saw that in the third year of Buhari’s government, they were not taking any measures in that direction, we started campaigning for it again to the extent that because of the public outcry, the party was forced to set up the (Nasir) El-Rufai panel on constitutional review. The panel made some key recommendations, including that there must be devolution of power to the states. That is to say that many of the functions currently being performed by the central government ought to return to the states. Also, there should be fiscal federalism and thirdly, states that wish to merge should be allowed to do so. State police were also recommended and many others.      
What we are asking President Tinubu to do is not NADECO’s matter, but for him to fulfill the promise that his party made to the Nigerian people. There is no doubting the fact that out of all those who have governed Nigeria, no one has a unique expertise, knowledge, or professional understanding of economics and finance like Bola Tinubu. Our challenge to him is that he should make an appropriate socio-economic policy that will quickly lift Nigeria out of the current intolerable level of poverty and economic miseries that Nigerians are going through. My only fear is that the currently warped, skewed, and lopsided national structure handed over to us by the military could be an issue in his will, but he is a streetwise guy who is capable of navigating his way through so that he can deliver to the people.
Since the military handed over the lopsided structure, why has it been difficult for the subsequent civilian government to change the current structure you are talking about?
Which civilian government? We gained independence in 1960. The civilian government was in office for a few years, and then the army struck. Until now, we have been subjected to military governance in Nigeria. Don’t deceive yourself that some civilians are in government. Democracy has been subverted and violence has been done to democracy. The military had undermined the propagation, nurturing, and popularisation of democracy in Nigeria. Many of them will not change the structure because they know how they got into office. That is why I said Bola Tinubu is a different kettle of fish. He has been an activist with us and Nigerians expect that he is in a position to write the wrongs, and now is the time, although sometimes, many who are voted into such office will not like the size of their power and influence to diminish.
Are you saying the current system of government practised in Nigeria cannot get the country the development it desires?
As it is today, it will never. It has violated all the basic universal principles because the current system has unitarised and centralised governance; it has resulted in the emergence of public policies that are unfair and bring injustice, inequity, discrimination, and total disregard and contempt for the rule of law. That is why the development we desire cannot be achieved. Since the end of Obasanjo’s military government, Nigeria has become a country of the opposite. We go to some African countries to preside over elections when we cannot run free, fair, and credible elections ourselves here. We export what we don’t have and we import what we have like petroleum. I hope that the current effort by President Bola Tinubu will be made to materialise quickly to change the misfortune that has befallen Nigeria. So, this system cannot produce results.
When you say the state should determine local government workers’ pay, there have been concerns that some state governors are spending and mismanaging the local government funds. What do you make of this?
Again, that is what the military did when they created the joint account (JAAC) provision in the constitution. There was nothing like that before. Under the federal constitution, there are constitutional provisions as to the responsibilities of the local government and how to source their funding. For instance, market, and radio licensing was the responsibility of the local government. Today, several responsibilities that should ordinarily be handled by the local government are now been carried out by the state forcefully.        
The military sowed the seed of malfunctioning taken place in the local government. Again, several people who have governed their state are supposedly worse than armed robbers in the way they pilfer local government funds. But is it their fault that JAAC was created? If it was not created, they couldn’t have the audacity to be doing so. The state should set up guidelines.
You were said to have described President Tinubu as the most competent President of Nigeria, but supporters of Peter Obi, Abubakar Atiku, and others will not agree with you on that. How did you come to this conclusion?
That is a general statement. I said that with his expertise in economy and finance; he has a comparative advantage over all his predecessors. I didn’t say he is the most competent but when you talk about economy and finance, who else has that knowledge? Is it (Olusegun) Obasanjo, (Goodluck) Jonathan, (Umaru) Yar’Adua, (Sani) Abacha, (Ibrahim) Babangida, (Muhammadu) Buhari, (Johnson) Aguiyi-Ironsi, Muritala Muhammed or who? This is one person who is a chartered public accountant, treasurer, and auditor. He has run successful businesses on his own. So, in terms of these areas I have mentioned, he is well prepared for the task ahead.
But despite these areas that you have mentioned, some of the President’s recent policies have been said to have plunged Nigerians into poverty. What is your take on this?
I don’t believe you. It is as if you guys who are supposed to be purveyors of information, write on the spur of the moment. Buhari budgeted for subsidy up till the end of May and Bola Tinubu was sworn into office on May 29. You are asking the National Assembly which has not been constituted at that time to approve funds for subsidy. Look at what has happened since the removal of the subsidy. The amount of oil consumption that has been reported has gone down by almost 40 to 45 per cent.
Perhaps it’s because the increase in price of the petrol and lack of money made many people abandon their cars which led to that reduction, or what do you think?
Listen, those who are benefiting from the subsidy are a very small number of people. They give bogus numbers as what they have imported which is not true most time. They collect the money for themselves whereas the government is forced to pay from N2tn to N3tn as subsidy. So, I don’t expect the kind of knowledge that President Bola Tinubu has to continue with the subsidy. Perhaps the method he used in removing it might be different from someone else, that is his style. What I expect him to do is to bring to reality, a quick measure of what he has started; to ensure that the natural gas that we have in abundance is been utilised to fuel our vehicle and others. Globally, fossil fuel is the most unwise thing to pursue; alternative fuel is what COP28 currently insists on. President Bola Tinubu has appointed young people into his cabinet whom I believe should be able to bring technology-based innovation into the government.      
In a bid to carry out some level of restructuring, former President Jonathan constituted the Oronsaye’s committee which presented its report, and Buhari set the report aside. Do you think President Tinubu should implement the report?
President Tinubu must do so, and one thing I give to him is that he is a street-wise politician. There is no basis for a lot of ‘job for the boys’ agencies that the military had created. They just duplicated the functions of the ministries, which is why we have been spending over 80 per cent of our total earnings on recurrent expenditures. For the first time, we have a budget where both expenditures; recurrent and capital, are at almost the same level. Perhaps that is the beginning of better things to come, but for it to materialise and be institutionalised, he needs to ensure the implementation of the critical recommendation of the Oronsaye panel’s report.
We spend too much money on just one job because they created a different organisation for one job. There used to be a Police Traffic Department in control of our highways and they were performing. If they had spent the amount of money on that department as what is currently been spent on FRSC, we would have achieved better results. Also, if the Nigeria Army had not downgraded the Nigeria Police, the police intelligence department would have continued to be the best it was. Even until the coup of (Buka) Dimka, the Nigerian Army depended on the police intelligence report. So, there would have been no reason for the establishment of the EFCC.
You can say we have such agencies in other parts of the world but we don’t have their kind of economy because we are an underdeveloped economy and not developing. We don’t have that luxury. And any country that has the misfortune of having an underperforming police has been done for. The army decided because they didn’t want competition from the Nigeria Police; they undermined the development and progress of the Nigeria Police. In 1980, the police clamoured for ordinary water canon as soon as the Buhari government came into office; they ceased all of them from the police. Most of the things that should make the police become up-to-date technology-wise have been undermined for too long. The manner of recruitment into these security institutions undermines their efficiency.
One of the provisions of the Oronsaye’s report is the need to reduce the cost of governance but with the huge number of appointees in President Tinubu’s cabinet, the cost of governance is further increased. What do you make of this?

Give it to politicians, they will always play politics and I believe this political gamesmanship is on. Sooner than later, he will do what he needs to do. Again, for his emergence, you should appreciate that he could have rarely appropriated to himself a lot of IOUs which he had to pay back, which made it possible for him to win votes in some unexpected places. If he is accommodating some of them in his cabinet, you should give it to him. Again, remember when he was a governor in Lagos, he was the first governor to take a loan from the stock exchange at a particular reduced rate; the money was used for several infrastructural development in the state, which most states, including the central government then copied.
When he took the loan, he was conscious that taking the loan at that interest rate then was far better than waiting for the federal allocation and IGR where perhaps the cost of building the infrastructure would have increased. So, some of the things he is currently doing might be strange and awkward and it would yield development with time. Yes, there is no basis for crowding in governance; it is too much expense for the country to bear. That is why most of the citizens cannot earn N33,000 minimum wage, but you see what the politicians are earning.  
Perhaps that is the reason why it is said that many are ready to kill others for political office.
Of course yes. Today, politics and religion are the most lucrative businesses that you have in the country. Most of the facilities and warehouses belonging to industrial establishments in Ikeja had been taken over by churches. So, the truth is that because of social economic, and political policies through military interchanged with their civilian collaborators, they undermined the essence of governance. They have not set up social economic and political policies that will aid local and foreign investment in our land. As soon as oil was discovered, they abandoned the mainstay of Nigeria’s economy which is agriculture.
Do you think with the current security structure, state governors are incapacitated to protect their states and regions?
How can they defend themselves? What police power do they have? Nothing! Some of the governors are spending state resources to finance the police operations in their state, yet they don’t have overall control over the police.
The Yoruba nation and Biafra agitators have always clamour for separation from Nigeria. Don’t you think such agitations should be shelved especially since the current President is from the South?
You call some of them agitators; they are terrorists whereas those who are disadvantaged and are been marginalised call them nationalists and defenders of their territories. Even in the Independence constitution, there was a clause that allowed individual regions to opt out if they wanted. But the British for their economic and political reasons, among the political leaders, refused. If you run the country well, nobody will agitate that they want to secede.
Some regions in the country, including the Niger Delta region, have raised concerns about maginalisation and that they are been deprived of the full benefit of their resources. How can the feelings of these aggrieved regions be assuaged by the current administration?      
We should return to federal constitutional governance, and that situation will be solved.
The Director of Defence Media Operations of the Nigerian Army, Maj. Gen. Edward Buba, recently listed the Yoruba self-determination movement as a threat to the peace in the South-West zone. How will you react to this?
You know why I will not want to dignify him with any response; it is because it is a constitutional right of every individual to defend himself. General (Theophilus) Danjuma about three or five years ago told the people in Taraba State to defend themselves when some people were trying to erase them from their land. So, if any military man is saying that, it is a by-product of unitary, centralised governance that we are having in Nigeria, otherwise if we had a federal system where defence and security are federalised, it would not be so.
With recent development, it appears the judiciary now decides who wins an election in Nigeria, and no longer the people. Are you not concerned about this?
Elections should not be decided by the Nigerian Judiciary. It is destructive of the independent nature of the judiciary to be asked to impose who will govern the people for a particular period. The Nigerian people should do so at the polling unit. But that is when you conduct a free, fair, and credible election. Late former President Umaru Yar’Adua recognised that the election that Obasanjo conducted was the greatest assault on democracy and free elections; so, he set up the Justice Mohammed Uwais electoral reform panel which recommended things to do. None of those recommendations were implemented. For instance, the committee recommended that the electoral management committee should not be appointed by the sitting government. It is just like when you have a football match between Shooting Stars and Enugu Rangers, then you ask a nominee of Enugu Rangers to be the referee. Don’t you know the result already?
The panel recommended that anyone who wants to be INEC chairman or commissioner should apply. The Nigeria Judicial Council should sort the applications and make three recommendations to the National Council of State and they will then refer to the Senate for confirmation. However, the Nigerian state is not interested in that recommendation because that panel recommended the addition of representatives of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Nigeria Bar Association, and some other interest groups to INEC so that the electoral management committee will be free and independent.
Another recommendation was that there must be the establishment of an electoral offences commission which will have prosecutorial powers so that anyone who commits an electoral offence should be arrested by the police and prosecuted. In spite of all that had taken place, who has been prosecuted for electoral offences in Nigeria? This is so because those whom they have assisted to get into office will have the power to appoint an attorney general or commissioner for justice who has authority by law to enter a Nolle prosequi which is a discontinuation of the case.        
We, the CODER (Coalition of Democrats for Electoral Reforms), sat down to review Uwais report and we made another recommendation that anyone supposedly elected but whose election is been challenged judicially should not be sworn into office until the judicial intervention has been finalised but it was not adopted. We went ahead to say that the burden of proof as to whether an election has been conducted fairly, and credibly should shift to the electoral commission because they have all the documents.
But with the situation, some people appear to have lost faith in INEC and the judiciary. What is your advice to the government to set things right?
If you return to federal constitutional governance, most of these problems are byproducts of the centralist and unitary system of government that we currently practice. In America, there is no central electoral committee. Each state conducts its elections.
But there are state electoral commissions like LASIEC for Lagos, OYSIEC for Oyo, etcetera, which conduct the state elections except governorship and National Assembly polls.
Yes, but we are only messing up everything. If we return to the federal system upon which Nigeria secures its independence, most of the crisis that you have will be reduced to the barest minimum. All the aberrations that the military has imposed upon us that have led us to this situation of injustice, unfair play, inequity, and total disregard for the rule of law can be tackled appropriately. And because as Nigeria, we have not been able to govern ourselves properly and we have not been able to establish a modern transparent, and productive government; we have been an abysmal failure to the black race which looks up to us to provide leadership for the black man.
Some Nigerian languages may go extinct if nothing is done to protect them. What are the measures that can be put in place to ensure languages like Yoruba and Igbo are protected?
Again, return Nigeria to federal constitutional governance, and then you will solve that problem. South Africa has just about 60 million people, do you know how many national lingua franca they have? About 11! How many do you think they have in Canada? Are you not concerned about the evil the British imposed on us? Between 1844 and 1848, even the Christian missionaries agitated seriously that the British government should allow Nigeria’s education system to be based on individual native languages, but it was rejected.      
In the 60s, the late Professor Babs Fafunwa and his team at the Obafemi Awolowo University, then the University of Ife conducted research and divided the province into two. They used the Yoruba language to teach Primary 1 to the end and the other they used the English language, the result showed that those who were taught the Yoruba language performed excellently better than those taught in English. Can’t you understand the wickedness that the British have done to us? Does a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Philippine need the English language to thrive? Are they not performing better than the British in Science and Technology? Our young people are deprived of understanding their culture, tradition, and morals. You must not speak in your native tongue as they describe it as vernacular. They flog you in the school for speaking the Yoruba language. Yes, some can speak it but when it comes to writing it and responding to questions, many fail.
Are you saying that schools should stop teaching the English language?
That is why a return to federal constitutional governance will enable the regions and states to do that.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06200850/Ayo-Opadodun.jpg

Hyacinth Alia, has ordered the immediate suspension of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress for the Guma 1 State Constituency.
The governor, who gave the order while briefing journalists on Saturday on the conduct of the primary, regretted that the delegate election was marred by irregularities and insecurity.
Guma 1 State Constituency seat in the State House of Assembly was declared vacant following the resignation of Dr.Yamar Ortese who was appointed a commissioner.
Election to fill the vacant position is expected to be conducted next month, hence, the primary election is to pick the candidate. 
An eyewitness told journalists earlier that the venue of the primary characterised by irregularities.
The development drew the attention of the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Mr. Paul Biam, who acted as the state official observer to the primary election.
“The Chief of Staff demanded that the gate be forced open only to discover that the national credentials of the officials of the APC assigned to conduct the primary election were not found and the election materials were not available at the venue.

“At the end of the day, Peter Terwase Uche was announced to have scored 25 votes against Maurice Orwough, who polled three votes,” an eyewitness who did not want his name in print said.
Following the irregularities that marred the conduct of the primary, Alia ordered the suspension.
The governor said, “This day, the APC is to conduct primary, but it was marred by misconduct, and this poses insecurity in Guma. It became imperative to calm the youth and party stakeholders who felt disenchanted. I would not want the effort of our security to go to waste. We do not want any semblance of insecurity in the state.
“I suspend the delegate primary election. Sad enough, the party faithful came out but were stopped at the gate by people who did not belong to the local government; all stakeholders were locked out and youths became angry, party faithful must help keep the peace in the state.
“I do not want any bloodshed as people get sensational and sentimental about politics. I have asked the security operatives to ensure that there is no breakdown of law and order. I know that the National Working Committee of our party will do all to ensure that the right thing is done.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/24021351/Hyacinth-Alia-e1695518030345.jpeg

Wike, who arrived in Port Harcourt, was hosted by Giadom in Bera, his country home in Gokana Local Government Area of Rivers State on Saturday.
The immediate past Rivers State governor expressed happiness to have mended fences with his estranged friend, Giadom, who was Commissioner for Works under former Governor Rotimi Amaechi.
Wike, in a video seen by our correspondent, boasted that the person in charge would soon be known. 
The former governor has been at loggerheads with the state governor, Siminalayi Fubara.
The situation led to a situation where lawmakers loyal to the minister served the governor an impeachment notice.
With the intervention of President Bola Tinubu, however, the lawmakers who defected to the APC from the Peoples Democratic Party have withdrawn the impeachment notice.      
But during the visit, Wike said, “Forget about these hungry noisemakers on the road. When the time comes, we will know who is in charge and who is not in charge. There is a time for everything.
“This is not time for politics. When the time comes, we will know who is who. If you like, abuse me as you want. If you like, employ everybody on social media. I have never bothered myself one day to know who is abusing me.
“Politics will come. We didn’t contest elections based on social media. We spoke to the people; they listened and believed in us”.
Speaking on his visit to Giadom, Wike said he was not in Bera (Giadom’s hometown) for politics, saying his visit should not be misinterpreted.
He stated, “I came here to visit my friend, Giadom. Let nobody misinterpret why I came here. That is why I came with PDP and APC leaders. It is a private visit to my friend”.
The FCT Minister however explained that Giadom had gathered his people to show he was still politically relevant, stressing that politics was about impacting positively on the people.
“I have never been in doubt about your capacity (referring to Giadom) to relate with your people. Politics is about impact. If you want to be a successful politician you must impact your people so that when you call them they will answer you,” Wike said.          Related News  Rivers crisis: I've fulfilled my part of peace deal - Wike  Supreme Court verdict: Like Wike, Like Abba Yusuff  We're praying you dump PDP, APC chieftain tells Wike   
Wike further said he is loved and valued by many across the country because he served the people, which is why many times people want to take pictures with him.
On his realignment with Giadom, he said: “Party will come and go and friendship will remain. We have made our mistakes, we are all humans but friendship remains.
“When I was appointed a minister, Victor Giadom led a team to congratulate me. It does not matter where you belong what is important is the interest of Rivers. If you want to be a successful politician, greedy ones will not like you.
“Nobody has done well in politics without enemies. Those who hate you are in the minority. Those who love you are in the majority”.
Wike stated that it was during his tenure as Rivers Governor that people heard much about the state, even as he vowed to continue supporting the Tinubu-led government.
He added, “When I was governor, Nigeria heard about Rivers State. That is what I have always preached. So, nobody should be afraid. I have no regrets when I stood by with my colleagues and friends that the presidency must go to the south.
“There was nothing I was not offered. But I said no. That is why I will continue to support the government of Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu. As I am going back home, I am going with the satisfaction that my friend is back.
“This visit I came today will cause a lot of trouble. Some people will start visiting now. Follow who knows the road. Continue to support Victor and all your leaders who mean well for all of you.      
“For the first time in history, Ogoni man is the chairman of works. I am happy that Ledum Mitee is a member of the NNPCL. Let nobody do community problems. When you do that development will not come”.
Speaking earlier, Giadom described Wike’s visit as the homecoming of a brother, a friend and a leader and assured him that they would support a team he would lead in Rivers.
Giadom said, “Today is a homecoming of a brother, a friend and a leader. I stand here on this ground to let you know that we have lived well, paid our dues and contributed to the development of this place.
“Be assured that we will support the team you will lead in Rivers to provide support for our President, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is the main reason we are all here today. This place nobody can challenge any visitor on this soil. We are in firm control of this place.”

Ngige listed the completion of the Second Niger Bridge, school feeding programmes, and Enugu Airport, among others, as some of the projects carried out by the last administration.
The former Anambra State governor stated these in an interview with journalists on Saturday, in Alor, Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State, while distributing palliatives to indigenes from the 21 local government areas of the state.
He explained that his faction remains the authentic APC in Anambra, insisting that there was no crisis in the party. 
He said, “It is not true that the Buhari administration was a failure. I was part of the government and the administration completed a lot of projects including the Second Niger Bridge, school feeding programme and numerous railways across the country.
“There is APC one and two in Anambra State. I won’t deny that fact. I am the father of APC here, I am the face of APC in Anambra State and I know for certain that we have newcomers who have been coming since the year 2021 and because the party is like a church, you don’t stop people from entering a church to seek salvation, so also you can’t stop people from entering a party to support government in power.
“We allow everybody but there is a segregation already because the new members don’t want to reckon with the old members who have laboured for the party from the time we were SDP to ACD, AC to ACN and then finally liberated as APC when we collapsed with NNPP and CPC. These are facts, and I don’t like denying things are facts.”        Related News  Tinubu’s culture of duty over leisure  Forex scandal: EFCC combs Dangote HQ for documents, probes 51 firms  Concentrate on security, road construction, Ngige urges Soludo   
While responding to how APC will wrestle the ruling APGA in Anambra for the governorship race in the state in 2025, Ngige said, “Don’t worry for us, this is politics and in politics, you disagree to agree. One day if you don’t agree, you bear the consequences. We didn’t agree in the 2021 election and the result was clear in Anambra State.
“I am optimistic that APC will take over in Anambra come 2025 for if you are not optimistic in life, then you go and commit suicide. So, optimism is with us. It is our watchword in APC. We have not done what we are supposed to do here but I am hopeful that between now and 2025, when the governorship election will be held in Anambra, we will have put our house in order and take over from APGA.”
The former minister who promised to distribute more food items like bags of garri and cartons of tomatoes to citizens next week, said, “I am still on sabbatical leave, resting and by the end of May this year when I would have rested for one year, I will decide and publicise my next line of action.

“Previously, we distributed 2,000 bags of rice, this time around, it was increased to 4,500 bags with yams because lots of homes and people are hungry and I do not want to call it poverty.

“Last farming season, Nigeria was unlucky as banditry and flooding caused havoc to farmers. Food-producing areas of Anambra State were affected and more of our people fell into that category, so we have three categories of the people we are catering for – APC members, people living with disabilities and elderly from the 21 Local Government Areas of Anambra State.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14143507/President-Muhammadu-Buharu-and-Labour-Minister-Chris-Ngige.jpg
politics,South-East govs’ endless  battle with insecurity,"MUHAMMED LAWAL examines the unending security challenges in the South-East and how the governors of Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra, Enugu, and Abia states have tried to put a stop to the killings and kidnapping...",6th January 2024,https://punchng.com/south-east-govs-endless-battle-with-insecurity/,muhammed lawal,"MUHAMMED LAWAL examines the unending security challenges in the South-East and how the governors of Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra, Enugu, and Abia states have tried to put a stop to the killings and kidnapping in the region
For the past eight years, Nigeria has been plagued with multifaceted issues of insecurity across the country. The need to combat kidnapping, killings, and destruction of property forced some state governors to create regional security outfits. There is no doubt that the northern geopolitical zone recorded several killings up till last year followed by the South-East geopolitical zone.
Rising violent crimes by criminal gangs particularly kidnappers, bandits, terrorists, and armed Fulani herdsmen have for years rendered many states insecure and unsafe for the people and smothered peace in the country.
In response to the disturbing development, on January 9, 2020 the South-West states, except Lagos State, established Amotekun, a regional security outfit. Though this was opposed by the Federal Government, the region had deemed it fit to manage the affairs of the security outfit for its sustainability. 
At that time, the South-East inaugurated forest guards to secure the forests in the region and stop criminals from making them (forests) their hideouts, but this was not effective as the region continued to witness interminable attacks from suspected Fulani herdsmen. Residents of the region expressed dissatisfaction over their governors’ futile efforts to combat the incessant attacks by these criminal gangs.
While some of the criminal gangs acted as separatist groups agitating for Biafra, others kidnapped for ransom and killed their own for no reason. Most disturbing was the kidnapping and killing of monarchs. Recall that the traditional ruler of Otulu community in the Ezinihitte Mbaise Local Government Area of Imo State, Eze Joe Ochulor, was murdered in November 2023. The king’s lifeless body was found by the roadside in Mbutu community in the neighbouring Aboh Mbaise Local Government Area.
Amidst the security challenges that crippled economic activities, posed threats to life and property, and altered the peaceful co-existence in these states, on April 11, 2021, southeastern governors, in an emergency meeting at the Imo State Government House, came together for a security discussion. In this meeting, the setting up of a regional security outfit codenamed Ebubeagu was announced to subdue these challenges in the region. It was reported by The PUNCH that the announcement came in the wake of violent attacks on the Imo State Police Headquarters and the National Correctional Centre, all in Owerri, the state capital.      
The governors had after a meeting directed the Attorneys-General and Commissioners for Justice of the five South-East states to work with the joint security committee to come up with the amendment of the existing state laws to reflect the new Ebubeagu security outfit.
The governors, in a communiqué read by the then chairman of the South-East Governors’ Forum and governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, said the security outfit, with its headquarters to be sited in Enugu, the Enugu State capital, would collaborate with the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies in the region.
“Ebubeagu will work with the Police and other security agencies in her operations to protect lives and property in the South-East. The attorneys-general and commissioners for Justice of the South-East states have been directed to work with the joint security committee to come up with the amendment of the existing state laws to reflect the new Ebubeagu outfit,” the communiqué read in part.
However, before the creation of Ebubuagu, the Indigenous People of Biafra founded the Eastern Security Network to tackle the pervasive attacks by armed herdsmen in the region and to proffer remedies to the unsafe surroundings that made going and coming to the region disastrous.
The peace project
In all this, the House of Representatives believes that the establishment of a South-East Development Commission will restore peace in the region and bring an end to the endless violent incidents in the geo-political zone.
Saturday PUNCH reports that President Bola Tinubu, in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, promised that he would use available resources to ensure lasting peace and security in the South-East. President Tinubu made the promise while unveiling the Logo of the Peace in the South-East Project, PISE – P, a strategic platform for the restoration of peace in the South-East region envisioned by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Benjamin Kalu.        
Also, the Chairman of the South-East Governors’ Forum and Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma applauded Ben Kalu for the initiative of the peace project, noting that Ndigbo would embrace anything that would bring peace to the South.
Ebubeagu, ESN at loggerheads
However, things became awry when facts emerged that Ebubeagu had been rejected by the pro-Biafra group, saying the government outfit would be an extension of the conventional security agencies, warning that “one must give way for the other.”
On May 9, 2021, the IPOB’s spokesperson, Emma Powerful, described Ebubeagu as an imaginary outfit that won’t work, adding that the governors should not be trusted. He said, “When our people needed them for protection, they were nowhere to be found. Instead of standing to be counted, they were rather waiting for instructions. And now that their masters have instructed them on what to do, that is why they hurriedly announced the imaginary outfit. We know their mission. The outfit will be an extension of the Nigerian security agencies to spy on our gallant Eastern Security Network and other pro-Biafra groups,” Powerful said
Also, on May 9, 2021, the late former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, said, “This cannot be left to any group except the elders. Those of us who can be called the elders in the whole of the South-East need to work hard, and very hard. We had wanted it long ago, not Ebubeagu but a central regional security system like Eastern Security Network.
“The ESN eventually came because there was no such central system; now that we have a central system, the best thing we can do as elders is to get the governors and IPOB together in whatever way we can do it without offending any group, and work out an arrangement whereby the ESN and Ebubeagu could cohabit.
“The point is really clear; everybody likes the ESN, but you know the ESN is not from an elected government. It is not a people’s movement as such because we voted for the people in government. We didn’t vote for IPOB but we are grateful to them for what they have done to help save our lives. But Ebubeagu, on the contrary, can be said to be a people’s security outfit because it was set up by the government elected by the people.”      
Ebubeagu’s disbandment
This security outfit established by the South-East governors allegedly turned out to be a menace in the states. They had been suspected to be involved in several killings across the states. This, however, led to people criticising them for terrorising the communities as they could not live up to their main expectations.
Recounting the ordeal of the government security outfit, a survivor of the July 17, 2022 killing at Awo Omamma in the Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, Nnamdi Nnanna, narrated to The PUNCH how operatives of the state-owned Ebubeagu security outfit allegedly shot seven of his brothers dead in his presence.
Recall that on July 20, 2022, the family of two siblings killed alongside 12 others on July 17, 2022, while returning from a traditional wedding at Awo Omamma in Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, had called on the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba; and the state governor, Hope Uzodimma, to ensure justice was done in the matter.
Again, the Ndigbo Unity Forum told governors of the South-East to immediately disband the Ebubeagu vigilance outfit set up to checkmate the activities of suspected criminals because of the incessant, unwarranted, and extra-judicial killings of innocent and unarmed youths in the zone.
On February 14, 2023, the Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki disbanded the South-East security outfit in Ebonyi State. According to the court, the disbandment of the security outfit was a result of human rights abuses, extortions, illegal arrests, and the use of firearms.
Govs’ efforts for peace  
On July 28, 2019, the South-East Governors’ Forum announced that it would launch forest guards in the states to fight insecurity in the zone. This was stated at the end of the meeting where they agreed to set up a committee and a centre for the South-East Integrated Security Monitoring/Intelligence Gathering to be centrally located in Enugu.
On August 10, 2023, in a bid to foster peace in the region, five governors of the South-East states met at the Government House, Enugu State. One of the key agenda of discussion was the Monday sit-at-home enforced in the region by the IPOB and the demand for the release of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the separatist group, IPOB, who has been in custody since June 2021.
Recently, the governors of the five South-East states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo states and some monarchs were expected to meet in Umuahia on Friday 29, 2023 to unveil the ‘Peace in South East Project’. Governor Uzodinmma, who leads the governors in the region, was present at the meeting to give the support of the governors to Ben Kalu’s peace project.
However, only time will tell if the project will be instrumental to finding a lasting peace in a region that has suffered so much kidnapping and killings for a long time.
Stakeholders react
Lending his voice on the matter, the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, noted that insecurity was not peculiar to the South-East, adding that there should be a change in the security architecture of the country.
Ogbonia said, “I want to point out that the insecurity in the South-East is not peculiar to the region alone. You can see what happened in Plateau State where about 150 were massacred in what we can call genocide. If you go to the North-West, it is similar. The only place I can say is safe now is the South-West. All over Nigeria, you can see certain levels of insecurity.      
“I want to thank God that we have not heard sad stories across the South-East states lately. It has been free from killings and other forms of news. For now, people are still enjoying themselves. As of now, there is no record of any threat to life.
“I can also assure you that (Nuhu) Ribadu started working but it has not been functional at the central level, but at the state level, it was functional. Ribadu was functional at Ebonyi State, Imo State. The only difference is the nomenclature because, in Enugu State, we still have vigilantes, and the same thing in Anambra State.
“But what we are working on is the central command structure, Ebubeagu in the whole South-East. I can tell you that every state has its own system. On that basis, they have a lot to provide a certain level of security in the states. What is happening across the country today; one cannot say that it (insecurity) is peculiar to the South-East alone. I am also confident that this new set of governors has come with service to the economy and security. They are working out plans to build a central structure to have central coordination.
“Above all, what Ohanaeze is calling for is the three or four levels of security architecture, where we will have such security structure at the state and local government levels and a place like the university. This is one of the characteristics of a federal system. It is only in Nigeria that we have a central policing with Civil Defence which is in the central command. This is not appropriate for a federal system. What we are asking from the Federal Government is equity and fairness.”
Commenting on the issue of insecurity in the South-East region, the National Vice Chairman of the Labour Party in the South-East, Innocent Okeke, said that the level of insecurity in the South-East was disturbing.
He said, “The governors come together to tackle insecurity and I don’t think they are sincere to themselves. In the beginning, they came together and said they formed Ebubeagu and it later became a nightmare in the South-East. However, Ebubeagu was proscribed in Ebonyi State and it is not in action in Anambra and Abia States. You can only find Ebubeagu in Imo State.
“You can’t say it’s a regional thing, only Imo State is operating Ebubeagu. The same Ebubeagu in Imo State has turned into a larger-scale disaster because 65 per cent of the killings and insecurity recorded in that area are caused by these men. My take is that the security situation in the South-East demands that the governors come together to declare a state of emergency on this security issue.        
“In declaring a state of emergency, they have to partner with the Federal Government, and their first request should be to review the policing institution that has been destroyed across the states. In Imo State, apart from maybe circulation in Owerri axis, you don’t find a police station anywhere functioning. There is nowhere you can achieve security and better policing if the police formation is not working well. So, if they do not come together with the Federal Government to seek to rebuild all these institutions, then what are they talking about tackling insecurity?
“Again, they are using their non-state actors and militia to battle the people who are causing trouble. I don’t think it’s yielding the needed dividends. They need to come together as a regional government and agree within themselves to have a common ground to tackle these menaces. I think some of them are enjoying it because they see it as an avenue for them to cause confusion and rig elections at any time just like what happened in Imo State when they made the people afraid to come out.
“In Nigeria, we know the state we are in, where injustice and marginalisation are the order of the day. So, people have the right to say this is what we are facing and the government must call people and say, ‘Okay, we listen to you; how do we go about this?’ It is not when the people scream and shout that you will now return fire for fire and the things will escalate. The issue of IPOB is not something that is out of control. If the state and federal governments come together, they will settle it.
“Finally, the release of Nnamdi Kanu will go a long way in relaxing the issues in the South-East and also open the door for reconciliation, and tackling of insecurity.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/05223038/TINUBU.jpg

The chairman of Rivers APC Caretaker Committee, Chief Tony Okocha, made the call when he led other members of the committee on a visit to the ‘Home for the Elderly,’ along Harbour Road, Port Harcourt and the ‘New Generation Vision Orphanage,’ in Elelenwo in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state on Thursday, where he presented gifts items and cash to the centres.
Okocha said the donations were keeping in tune with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
He stated, “We are in the administration of Tinubu, who the world knows as a very compassionate person. And of course that has cascaded down to us here as leaders of the APC in the state.     
“By the special grace of God, we were able to knock in some of these items and we share to our members and we made deliberate attempts to also share with indigent homes.

“We need to show that there could be a government that has compassionate for the less privileged, if we had the opportunity to be in control and in charge of the reigns of governance in the state, we would do better.”
Okocha, who is also the Rivers State representative on the management board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, encouraged well-meaning individuals, and corporate organizations to always give helping hand to those in need.      
He averred, “Citizens of the state who are well-to-do or wealthy should extend their goodwill. We need a lot of it. You can see that they can barely walk (those in the elderly home).
“So how do they fend for themselves? They can only fend for themselves via the goodwill that people extend to them. So it is my craving that anybody who has should extend to others. That is what life is all about.”

There is no gainsaying the fact that the intervention of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the feud between the governor of Rivers State, Siminalayi Fubara, and his estranged political godfather and Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, which eventually culminated in an eight-point resolution has calmed frayed nerves at least for now.
Although Fubara and Wike have both pledged commitment to implement the presidential resolution, their body language is saying otherwise.
For example, Wike, while attending the wedding anniversary of his associate and immediate past Commissioner for Works, Dr. Des George-Kelly at the Kings Assembly in Port Harcourt, shortly before Christmas, blamed his successor for the political crisis, insisting that he has failed to play by the rules of the game (politics) and urged people of the state not to involve themselves in a fight they know nothing about.
He stated, “Don’t get involved in any fight between two politicians without knowing the cause. 
“In any facet of life, there are rules and they must be obeyed. As a pastor, there are rules you must follow. So as politicians, we must follow rules.
“When I was governor, I followed those rules and that’s why I was able to succeed.”
On his part, Fubara, at his maiden state banquet at the Government House, Port Harcourt, on New Year’s Eve said those fighting him were after his ‘red biro,’ and boasted that he is still firmly in possession of the pen.      
The governor added, “What they want is this red biro, but it is still with me. We are the winners, because we are still signing with the red biro.”
Interestingly, the cold war snowballed into the yuletide with the two political leaders trying to buy the heart of the people or at best, ensure that their support bases are intact, especially in the spirit of the season.
Rice is a major staple food in the country, especially against the backdrop of how expensive it is, many will appreciate it as a gift and this was exactly what happened.
Customized bags of rice bearing the bold faces of Governor Fubara and Wike adorned Port Harcourt and its environs, with suspected aides of the duo distributing same to various stakeholders and groups so much so that it has set off conversations in the social media.  Related News  Tinubu sets up panel to audit social investment programmes  Rivers crisis: I've fulfilled my part of peace deal - Wike  Join me in developing Kano, governor woos APC candidate   
In one of the pictures on the rice bags seen by South-South PUNCH reporter, Fubara adorned a native attire with a hat to match, while Wike is seen in suit, in what many indeed believed was his official portrait when he held sway as Governor.
South-South PUNCH gathered that Wike gave 2,000 bags of rice to each local government area of Rivers State, while Fubara was said to have given 100 bags of his own brand of rice to each ward in the state.
Some of the groups that have benefitted so far include some political party members, youth groups, market unions, non-indigenes, landlord associations and counting.        
Commenting on the impasse and issues that came up, the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in the 2023 election in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe, while speaking on a popular radio station, Super 93.3 FM, Port Harcourt faulted the sharing process.
Abe, who had just announced his return to the All Progressives Congress, advised Governor Fubara, “Let me criticise Governor Siminalayi Funara. He sent rice; that rice should go beyond the PDP. It should not be for PDP alone. Give PDP, give APC, give SDP, and give everybody.”
One of the notices of sharing by a landlords association in the outskirts of Port Harcourt obtained by our correspondent reads, “Greetings. We are sharing the rice Governor Sim Fubara gave the Ibos as Christmas palliative @ Tama Galaxy Event Centre Rumuodara, East-West Road, by Overcomers Bus Stop.” The notice carried other information including time and other instructions to the beneficiaries while coming for collection.
For the FCT Minister’s rice, the stakeholder groups were called and informed on phone of the gesture and the item taken to them at their preferred locations.
A Facebook user, simply identified as Clarkson Diri, wrote sarcastically on his page, ‘The bag of rice with red background is full of sand, stones and not suitable for eating. When you cook it, it will not rise, while the other bag of rice with a touch of gold is a wow. Stone-free, suitable for eating, smells good and above all, once you cook, boom it will rise and rise…’
Suggestive of who where they have pitched their tent in the political crisis, another Facebook user wrote on his page, ‘The deceiver giving Rivers people rice with evil intentions.’
However, finding by our reporter reveals that the two well-packaged bags of rice contained clean and stone-free rice, which is very suitable for consumption. After all, there has been no complaint from any stakeholder groups who have been enjoying the staple food gifted to them for whatever reason, just as many people are craving for it.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/02235220/Siminalayi-Fubara-and-Nyesom-Wike.jpeg

The Independent National Electoral Commission had fixed the governorship poll for November 16, 2024.
Ebiseni, who defected to the Peoples Democratic Party recently, said this year’s governorship election was going to be a defining moment for the state.
Speaking in Akure, the state capital, on Thursday, the lawyer said the state needed a person who was properly grounded and had full knowledge of the state. 
He said, “First and foremost, if you follow the trajectory of governance from the Ajasin era, our state, has had a rare privilege of being governed by governors who are not only intellectually suave, grounded in their chosen carriers, thoroughly bred and groomed in the ideology of the Awolowo school of thought which defines our welfarist programmes with which our people and politics have been identified.
“Besides Ondo State is very proud and has produced Ajasin, Adefarati, Agagu, Mimiko and Akeredolu who were and are men who gave our state a delightful corporate image in the comity of governors. As one of the leaders of the party told me when I visited him on consultations, we must always strive to maintain such standards.

“Development of our state also requires being fully acquainted with the territory and the people. Such knowledge affords the new manager the opportunity of the location of resources, creates wealth therefrom and fairly allocate same without undue concentration in one or few places.”      
Ebiseni, claimed to have a comparative advantage over other contestants in the race, in the knowledge of the state, having served as a council chairman and three times commissioner in the state.
He said the diversification of the economy of the state from over-reliance on federal allocation, would be given top priority.
“Certain social services which set our state apart ideologically and which have been discontinued or abandoned must be resuscitated in terms of quality and affordable education and health services including the Mother and Child Hospitals which will be fairly extended in the zones and many of such welfare programmes.
“It is a cheap petit-bourgeois mindset to argue that the state cannot afford such existential programmes. I was privileged to be part of the team that accomplished this for the state, ‘ the Afenifere chieftain stated",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/04223118/Sole-Ebiseni.jpeg

The chairman of the Forum, Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, also thanked the administration for providing support and relief materials to the survivors and families of the slain.
Yahaya, who spoke to State House correspondents in Hausa Language, revealed the forum’s position after closed-door talks with the President at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja,
While citing Vice President Kashim Shettima’s visit to Kaduna and Plateau states, he also warned against spreading divisive narratives among communities, saying the gory killings were a result of such divisions. 
He said, “In my capacity as the Chairman of Northern Governors’ Forum, I praise the steps taken by the President to get to the root of what happened in these two states and the pledge he made that the right action would be taken to prevent future occurrence of these incidents.
“Above all, I thank him for supporting victims or survivors.”
He described the Plateau crisis as old, calling for a broader review of the immediate and remote causes to produce lasting solutions.      
“Even though this matter has been there for a long time, it is time for stakeholders to have a round table and tell each other the truth and then take deliberate steps toward loving each other. Before now, the people were living in peace and doing their regular business.
“Some major issues that seem to allow the problem to persist include farmer-herder clashes, the clamour for indigenes versus settlers.

“But the world over, if any society or country does not welcome visitors, such a nation will not progress. After all, we here are the same family,” he reasoned.
Yahaya sympathised with those who lost their loved ones, appealing for restraint from aggrieved communities who may be tempted to revenge.
He advised, “There should be no reason why anyone should go and kill or take the life of a fellow human being since it is not a war situation.
“Reprisal attacks have not taken us anywhere, so we need to concentrate on understanding ourselves and knowing that we have leaders at all levels to whom we can lodge our complaints.
“We should imbibe the habit of loving one another and living in peace for the progress of all of us.”        
Governor Yahaya also sought deeper collaboration between federal and state governments as this would ease development in all sectors for the good of Nigerians.
He noted that both tiers of government have shaken hands in healthcare and business-friendly reforms, saying, “Without the economy picking and doing well, we will continuously be where we are or even worse off.”
“Collaboration of the states and the federal government, in fact, including the local governments, is key and fundamental for us because if there is any disconnect, we may not deliver on what we must do for the people,” Yahaya added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01171733/muhammad-inuwa-yahaya.gif

Adams was accused of anti-party activities.
The statement announcing the suspension of the chairman was signed by nine of the 10 members of the SWC, who included, Tola Alabere, Dayo Awude, Oluseye Olujimi, Amos Fadope, Moses Awofade, Boluwaji Bamidele, Olawumi Fasonu, Dare Akinwale and Kennedy Peretei.

He said, “Today, the State Executive Committee of the party has validated the suspension of the state chairman (Adams). They have affirmed what the State Working Committee did.
“By our constitution, the SWC is to see the day-to-day running of the party, in other words, the SWC runs the party on behalf of the SEC, So whatever action the SWC takes overtime must be submitted to the SEC for approval, which is what we just did today.

It was reported that Adams was suspended by nine out of the 10 members of SEC of the party on Tuesday.
He was alleged to have been involved in anti-party activities.
However, Adams had stated that the move to suspend him was politically motivated, to remove him, for them to hatch their plans for the forthcoming bye-election in Akoko North East/North East Federal Constituency in February.
He said he remained the chairman of the party in the state, saying the party would not be taken over by unscrupulous elements who were out there to destroy the democratic values which the party is known for.
“This will not stand, we know what they are trying to do, they plan to remove me so that they can execute their evil agenda for the Akoko North East/North West Federal Constituency bye-election and we will not fall for that,” he reacted

Abe dumped the APC ...",3rd January 2024,https://punchng.com/abe-returns-to-apc-seeks-support-for-tinubu/,Dennis Naku,"The Rivers State Governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in the 2023 election, Senator Magnus Abe, has formally announced his return to the All Progressives Congress.
Abe dumped the APC for the SDP ahead of the 2023 election where he secured the party’s ticket to contest the governorship election.
But while speaking to newsmen shortly after a meeting with stakeholders in Port Harcourt on Wednesday, he said he has dumped the SDP for his former party.
He explained that his decision is to join other ‘well-meaning Nigerians’ to support the President Bola Tinubu-led administration, and to ensure that Rivers people benefit from the development at the centre. 
He stated, “The new year offers a lot of opportunities and hopes for all Nigerians and indeed all Rivers people. My message has been consistent that we all need to come together; work together to be able to harvest these expectations for our people.
“So basically I called my people here today to intimidate them of some of the ongoing issues and also to let them know that we are returning to the All Progressives Congress to join other well-meaning Nigerians to support the government of President Bola Tinubu. And to do our own best to also make sure that Rivers people are able to be part of the development at the centre and to also carry the state along in what we are doing.”
Abe added that he and his team members were not back to the party because of any individual.      
“We are in the APC because we are founding members of this party and we are grassroots supporters of the President. It is proper that we are in the party to continue to give that full support to the President’s developmental agenda,” he explained.

Asked how he intends to work with those he allegedly fell out with when he dumped the APC to pursue his governorship ambition, Abe said he was ready to work with others to ensure prosperity for Rivers people.
He added, “My coming to the APC is to work together with other members of the party to ensure growth, inclusion, prosperity and progress for Rivers State and Rivers people.
“If we all have the same mind, we will be party to achieving that. So, I think that this is a new year and everybody who wants the APC to move forward in Rivers State need to realise that the APC cannot be a personal estate of anybody.
“We are all very strong characters. There is none of those people, myself, Rotimi Amaechi, Nyesom Wike and Tony Okocha that is a walk over.But you will also agree that if all of us must come together, there should not be any other force in Rivers State that can stop us.
“So, I believe that if we can find a common ground which we have all found in the APC definitely there is a space for everybody.”
Meanwhile, the State APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Chief Tony Okocha,said Abe is welcomed to the party, describing him as a founding member of the party.        
Okocha said this while answering questions from newsmen shortly after he visited the New Generation Vision Orphanage in Elelenwo, Obio/Akpor Local Government Area and the Home for the Elderly in Port Harcourt, where he distributed items, including bags of rice, cartons of noodles, toiletries and cash donations.
He said, “In politics, it is the more, the merrier. I listened to one of his (Abe’s) conversations on air that he intends to return to the APC. Wecan’tstophim.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11154753/Magnus-Abe.jpg

Akinfolarin, a two-term federal lawmaker who represented the Ile-Oluji Okeigbo/Odigbo Federal Constituency between 2015 and 2023, declared that the state needed to be reconfigured. 
He stated this while speaking with journalists in Akure, the state capital, on Wednesday. 
The former federal lawmaker said, “Ondo state is full of potential, human and material alike. It is one of the most prosperous states in this country because we have so many things that can make us to be great.  
“Ondo State is where 70 per cent population are totally engaged in farming. But nobody is paying serious attention to that, all what we are doing is to bring projects that will bring money for us, we must start paying attention to the informal sector where we have the majority of our people.” 
Akinfolarin, who declared intention to contest for the forthcoming governorship election in the state on the platform of the APC, said the state needed someone who would bridge the gap between the government and the people.

“Although we have so many people on the ground my own case is different. If you look at the state of affairs in the state, you will all agree with me that Ondo State needs to be reconfigured, we need to reconfigure the developmental structure of this state. Because there seems to be some gaps between government and the people in recent times.       
“I’m properly rooted in this state, so I know what it takes to govern the Ondo state and with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, some of us think that we need to come together to move this state forward. 
“Based on my experience and antecedent, I have really navigated both the economic and political terrain of Ondo State, I know what governance is, and I know what can be done to give succor and hope to our people. People no longer have confidence in what the government is doing, we need someone to energise the system, we need someone to give assurance, we need someone to let us know that this government is our government,” he stated. 
On the death of the former governor of the state, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, the All Progressives Congress chieftain said there was a need for the state government to immortalize the late former governor. He described Akeredolu as a straightforward person. 
“We will be very unkind to Aketi(Akeredolu) if nothing is done to immortalise him. This was a man that came with good intentions, he did his best, he was not a pretender, he was a practical person and ensured not only the state but the entire southwest region was safe through the Amotekun Corps.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/14001735/Mayowa-Akinfolarin.jpg

He speaks with PETER DADA on the political state of the Sunshine State in this interview
You were once a member of the state Assembly, but you seem to have been out of the political space in recent times. What is happening? 
Sure I was. Yes, I have been quiet but still active. I have not contested any elective post in recent times. After serving a one-term legislative session in the Ondo State House of Assembly, I went to improve myself academically by going for a doctorate at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Enugu State. I later served as the Executive Chairman of the Ondo State Teaching Service Commission.
Is that not a sign of retirement from politics? 
No. I am not retiring from politics. For me, politics is a calling. I see it as an option to further serve humanity in general, with particular attention devoted to the community, the state and the country. Indeed, I see politics as a very veritable way of giving back. Such giving must however be honest in its entirety. Politics provides an enviable opportunity for one to commit our God-given endowments to improving our society as well as the quality of life of others around us.
You are one of the elders in the state. What is your view about the political crisis that rocked the state some months ago?
It is common knowledge that the crisis was caused by the failure to comply with the bidding of the 1999 Constitution as Amended (2011), which demands the transmission of power by a governor to his deputy, as and when necessary, for the smooth running of government. Fortunately, the needful was done and the acting governor has now become the substantive governor.      
The worst aspect of the sad situation, however, is the role of some individuals and groups in exploiting the matters for their selfish ends.
It was gathered that the reason the crisis lingered for so long is due to the 2024 governorship election. Do you believe that? 
Some have reasoned that the race and interests for the next governorship contest may be the root cause. Yes, it could be true, but the political actors engaged in the logjam had exhibited crass opportunism, insubordination, and total disrespect for constituted authority and the rule of law. They didn’t show enough love and respect for the late governor’s predicament.
Now that Aiyedatiwa has been made the substantive governor what do you expect from him and his administration, considering the previous crisis? 
First, allow me to congratulate Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa for surmounting the unwarranted political imbroglio with a high-level display of humility, strength of character, and dignifying poise. I also wish to acknowledge his wish in the maiden speech (during the swearing-in) to serve the state as the governor. His humble pledge of open-hearted, fair-minded and inclusive developmental government is welcomed by us.
While I pray God to grant the late Governor Akeredolu eternal rest and give his family and the state the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss, I will also pray God to continue to be with the current governor, grant him the strength and courage to do what is right for the good people of Ondo State, and in serving humanity.
In light of our wish for his success and positive impact on the lives of our people, I wish to encourage him to ensure that the 2024 budget estimates ( which he just passed into law) are realistic, open, participatory, and all-involving. He should also review all recent questionable policies of the state government, supplementary and or re-ordered budget estimates, the LCDAs law, and its attendant caretaker’s committees, necessarily for broader inclusion, respect for the rule of law, and obedience to the courts.        
I also wish he could immediately appoint a deputy governor that he would be able to work with. He should be able to attend to the well-being of the people, students’ bursaries, and support the market women, traders, artisans, and other private sector interests.
He should please attend, with dispatch, to the welfare and payment of arrears of the civil/public servants and pensioners, to cushion their plights in the face of the current economic hardships.
Concerning the allegations of the forged signatures of the late governor on various documents, it is exigent that the government must order banks warehousing state funds for an immediate revalidation of all the state government cheques sent to them, and a quick audit of all MDAs and the state government accounts as well as financial records/files.
These interventions are urgent and necessary for the sanctity and running of the affairs of government and for safeguarding the overall image of late Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s administration in Ondo State.
The governor must be prudent and avoid any waste of resources in governance. He must also be magnanimous to all stakeholders and provide expected critical leadership within the government and across the state.
Ayedatiwa with firmness and fairness to all in the demonstration of his authority should continue to be humble, honest, loyal, and committed to the good people of Ondo State.  Related News  PICTORIAL: Akeredolu's body arrives fromGermany  Aiyedatiwa promises to immortalise Akeredolu  Akeredolu was weak in matters involving his wife — Ex-aide   
Moreso, I advise that henceforth, he must be increasingly, consistently visible, and accessible to people with an open heart and all sincerity.      
It was gathered that the intervention of the elders prompted the meeting with President Bola Tinubu and some of the gladiators that ended the crisis. In what other ways did the elders intervene to ensure that such crises do not reoccur in the state? 
The Ondo State Elders and Leaders, under the auspices of Pa Reuben Fasoranti, were not relenting in their efforts until the political stalemate was resolved completely. Conciliation efforts that were initiated since September, and have since been vigorously pursued by the elders and leaders, will not cease until true rapprochements are achieved and good governance thrives once again in the state. Other than efforts on conciliation, the elders and leaders have insisted on absolute respect for the rule of law and its enforcement. Their conviction is that everyone is guaranteed deserved protection by the provisions of the laws and the Constitution of Nigeria
Do you have a forum of former lawmakers irrespective of party affiliation?
Yes, we do.
What roles did you play when the crisis was intense? 
I am aware that the All Progressives Congress flank of the forum in September this year, made a public call on the stakeholders, to be mindful of the heavy toll their negative actions would take on the public. Yet, some of the gladiators were recalcitrant, but members of the forum were not relenting.
Do you still have political ambition and what is your next move politically?   
As I said earlier, I have taken politics as a calling, an opportunity to serve my people and humanity honestly, and as such, I certainly still have political plans. In the meantime, I am praying for enduring good health and political goodwill to enable me to continue to be politically active and relevant. My next political move by the grace of God, should be at a higher level of calling.
Many political parties are engulfed in one crisis or the other, as a politician, what do you think is wrong with our party system in Nigeria? 
The political landscape in Nigeria currently is so unimpressive. First, there are too many parties registered by the Independent National Electoral Commission, such that you cannot easily remember the names of some of the parties. Yet, you cannot blame INEC. It is merely following the dictate of the constitution and the various court orders.
Today, it is very unlikely you find a political party operating on a clear-cut ideology or well-known philosophy. Whereas, successful political plans and strategies, growth, and development, should be fundamentally hinged on tested and helpful philosophies. The Action Group, the Unity Party of Nigeria, as well as the Alliance for Democracy, were all founded on the philosophy of social welfare while their political leadership acted on the core principle of Afenifere or life more abundant for all.
These three successive parties had been generally very successful because they each had an ideological roadmap to guide them every centimetre of the way. Those parties were genuinely committed to participatory democracy, unlike now that the political climate is shrouded in political absolutism, where most leaders are not only autocratic but majorly act as sole administrators. Until we become politically disciplined, and our parties are ideologically/philosophically rooted and managed, our democracy may continue to be incoherent and endangered.
With both political and economic crises everywhere in the country, are you not worried that Nigerian democracy is under threat? 
I am certainly worried. Any right-thinking and honest Nigerian should be worried about the political upheavals and economic downturn that continue to becloud our country. When political leaders in office openly profess preferences, hegemonic agendas and demonstrative indifferences, where is the hope of the commoners? Citizens become highly disillusioned and feel dismembered, not just politically, but socio-economically too.      
What do you think is the way forward?
We need a political rethink towards genuine, comprehensive and political restructuring of the country. The people of Nigeria are yet to become fully involved in or participate actively in decision-making, particularly where the constitution that governs them is concerned. What we have today is a quasi-military constitution, that smells suffocatingly of military unitarianism, and is therefore largely incapable of being generally acceptable to the generality of Nigerians.
Can you tell us about your political antecedents? 
I started as a youth and student leader in the Unity Party of Nigeria from 1979 to 1983. I was also a member of the Alliance for Democracy from 1999 to 2006. I however contested for the Ondo State House of Assembly representing the Akoko North West Constituency 1, in 2007 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. I was elected Speaker ODHA by my colleagues, and this allowed me to be a member of the Presiding Officers of the Legislative Houses of Nigeria. After my term in the House, I was appointed to the Ondo State Teaching Service Commission, as the Executive Chairman, in 2013 by Governor Olusegun Mimiko. I am currently the Secretary of the Ondo State Branch of Afenifere and was also graciously offered the post of Secretary of the Ondo State Elders and Leaders, by Papa Chief Reuben Fasoranti.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/03000332/Bakita-Bello.jpg

Yusuff, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, was reacting to a declaration by Aregbesola at a political event organised by the Omoluabi Caucus in Ilesa last Saturday.
The PUNCH had reported Aregbesola as saying at the event that, before the end of 2024, he would inform members of the Omoluabi Caucus his next move regarding Osun politics.
But Yusuff, while reacting to that claim by Aregbesola on a programme called ‘Oro Oselu’ aired on Rave FM, a private radio station in Osogbo, said the ex-governor was just struggling to provide political direction, but may not be able to achieve the feat again. 
The ex-member of the House of Representatives representing Osogbo/Olorunda/Irepodun/Orolu Federal Constituency, who said Aregbesola became governor through collective leadership, added that he, presently, does not have that capacity to lead any political system in the state.
He however said he still loves the former Interior Minister being a good political associate and friend that enjoyed limelight at the same period.
Speaking in Yoruba language in a two minutes 38 seconds video of the interview which went viral on the social media, and obtained by PUNCH Online in Osogbo on Tuesday, Yusuff further said, “Aregbesola did his best in the struggle that secured power to govern the state for the progressives in quote.

“If he is facing challenges now, I can’t be happy about it. But the only thing I know is that he is only struggling to regain that form. It may be out of his reach. Collective leadership made him governor. Just as I was unable to get my desired position and I am not sad about it, it will not be easy for him to return to Osun and lead any political system again.
“It is the time to say the truth. He (Aregbesola) is someone that I love so much. I don’t know if he loves me same way. That he opposed my ambition to be governor of Osun and Speaker of House of Representatives are past issues.
“But, him saying he would declare his next political move is a lie. Dynamics are no longer the same. Things have changed. But I won’t say Aregbesola will no longer be relevant politically because I am not God.”
When contacted for reaction, Sola Fasure, who is the Media Adviser to Aregbesola, said, “In the last two years, he (Lasun Yusuff) has been in APC, PDP and Labour Party. He sought to contest the last governorship election in the state on the platform of the three parties but finally got the Labour Party’s ticket.
“He was in, out, in and out again of the defunct The Osun Progressives, praising and denouncing the group, blowing hot or cold, as he deemed fit. Whatever he says therefore is a function of his pursuit at the moment.
“If you recollect, he had viciously attacked Aregbesola at one time and at another praised him to high heaven. You should therefore situate his statement in light of what he had said about Aregbesola in the past.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/21170500/Aregbesola.fw_.png

Also, he explained that the resignation of the factional Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Edison Ehie, from his position and the legislature was in the interest of peace.
Fubara disclosed this while addressing Rivera people at the maiden state banquet held by his administration at the Government House, Port Harcourt, on Monday, to celebrate the New Year.
The PUNCH reports that Governor Fubara and his predecessor, Nyesom Wike, after a truce meeting with President Tinubu on December 18, agreed to an 8-point resolution. 
According to the eight-point resolution signed at the end of the meeting, the President directed that all lawsuits instituted in the courts by Fubara and his team regarding the political crisis in Rivers State be withdrawn immediately.
The resolution was signed by Fubara; his deputy, Ordu; Wike; Ribadu; factional Speaker of the Rivers State Assembly, Martin Amaewhule; Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State, Aaron Chukwuemeka, and the All Progressives Congress Chairman, Tony Okocha.
The resolution amongst others, mandated Fubara to re-present the 2024 appropriation bill he had earlier presented to the four-member state House of Assembly to the full House.      
While wishing Rivers people a fruitful and prosperous 2024, he appealed to them to embrace the peace process at the instance of President Bola Tinibu.

“I’m appealing to every one of us to embrace peace. We need this peace because our intention for the state is not for our interest but for the development of the state.
“So when we are faced with this type of situation we consider the actions and reactions. Who is going to suffer? Fubara will not suffer, but one million supporters will suffer.”
The governor said his decision to embrace the eight-point resolution following the President’s intervention is not out of fear, but out of respect for elders.
” I want to leave you with only this message, we will not disappoint you. We also will not be involved in any dirty fighting because we know that we are going to be the losers.        
“Therefore, whatever it will take as seen in our decisions, yesterday (Sunday) a lot of people were worried about why would the Speaker resign. It is to tell you what we can do for peace to reign, ” Fubara stated.
The governor said his administration was determined to leave a legacy of unity and development in the state and not a legacy of political apprehension.
In his welcome address, the Secretary to the State Government, Dr Tammy Danagogo, thanked God that despite the political turbulence in the state, Fubara is focused on dispensing the dividends of democracy in the state.
He pointed out that the state is blessed to have a governor who is “calculated, humble, honest and hardworking”, and urged Rivers people to be apostles of peace, truth and justice for the state to continue on a trajectory of greatness.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/02103901/Tinubu-Fubara-and-Wike.png
politics,Gov poll: Edo Central agenda under threat as parties throw race open,"With the major political parties throwing their tickets open, the Edo Central, which has been calling for the zoning of the governorship ticket to the area, faces a stiff battle, writes ADEYINKA ADEDI...",2nd January 2024,https://punchng.com/gov-poll-edo-central-agenda-under-threat-as-parties-throw-race-open/,Adeyinka Adedipe,"With the major political parties throwing their tickets open, the Edo Central, which has been calling for the zoning of the governorship ticket to the area, faces a stiff battle, writes ADEYINKA ADEDIPE
WHEN political calculations and permutations were being done eight months ago in Edo State, no one would have thought that the Esan agenda which gained prominence and was aimed at producing the next governor of the state from the Edo Central senatorial zone, would suffer a setback.
The call to zone the ticket to the senatorial district by all the leading political parties gained ground as a socio-cultural group, Esan Okpa Initiative, led the way. The call was not out of place considering that the zone had only tasted power for 18 months since the Fourth Republic began in 1999 when Professor Oserhimen Osunbor was booted out by the court to pave the way for the emergence of Comrade Adam Oshiomhole in 2008.
The call won many admirers who felt that for equity, justice, and fairness, the zone should produce the next governor. With this, many politicians from the zone threw their hats in the ring with some aspirants moving to other parties to boost their chances of emerging candidates and eventually becoming the governor. 
The Public Relations Officer of Esan Okpa Initiative, Tony Iyare, a former Commissioner under Oshiomhole, had told the PUNCH eight months ago that the zone was speaking to Edo South and Edo North people to ensure that they support the Edo Central’s bid to produce the next governor of the state. According to Iyare, a mobilization and contact committee made up of 24 members and headed by the President of the group and pioneer speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Mathew Egbadon, was also set up to meet with leaders of the major political parties, the Peoples Democratic Party, All Progressives Congress, Labour Party, traditional rulers, and women to actualize this dream.
In a strong move to put the best hands forward, the zone listed criteria that the aspirants must meet to enjoy overwhelming support to succeed Governor Godwin Obaseki who will complete his second term in 2024.
Despite this lofty idea by the group, Gideon Ikhine, who is also from the zone had a different view and should be credited as the man who saw tomorrow. In an interview with The PUNCH, after he ended his 24 years sojourn in the PDP and moved to the APC, he warned that the idea might not see the light of the day as the right thing to do was to have an Edo State agenda to make Esan man the next governor of the state.      
He said, “I take exception to the Esan agenda clamour. There can never be anything like Esan agenda. I would rather go with Edo State’s agenda to make an Esan man the next governor of the state. Esan man does not have the power to say he wants to be the governor. It is the entire party structure that will decide that.
“The Edo South and Edo North will have to come together to give Edo Central (Esan) the chance to produce the next governor. For the Esan, it should be more like an appeal and lobby for other parts of the state to support candidates from the central part of the state. It should not be seen as a birthright. We will lobby and I know Edo North and South will walk towards that direction,” he added.
However, with the major political parties throwing the tickets open, the issue has caused acrimony among groups while some individuals are blaming others as the hope of an Esan man becoming the next governor dims.
The position of the Edo South leaders that every zone has the constitutional right to vie for governorship, has drawn the ire of other groups. The decision, which was reached at a meeting last week, had two former governors of the state, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun and Chief Lucky Igbinedion in attendance, while Governor Obaseki and the LP governorship aspirant, Olumide Akpata were also in attendance among other notable names.
After the meeting, Odigie-Oyegun told journalists that aspirants from every senatorial zone have the constitutional right to vie for the position of governor in the state’s 2024 election. Odigie-Oyegun, who is also a former national leader of the APC said, “We are looking at the Edo State unfolding political equation and at the end of the day we ask ourselves, what is in it for Edo South? The zone has the current governor, Godwin Obaseki and we are not complaining. But that the zone cannot afford to live in the past as the governor’s tenure will end this year. We have the governor, who will conclude his tenure in November this year, but nobody lives in the past.
“Nobody goes to bed and says the present is good and therefore he will not care about the day that will break tomorrow. We can’t be that stupid. We are looking at the immediate future and what we are seeing is not very interesting. So we are looking at how we can make amends, to be sure that we are not left behind in the scheme of things.”
He added, “Edo is noted for considering every zone and that is why we are the heartbeat of Nigeria. We will continue to show good examples and we pray that other parts of the country will learn from it. But that does not mean that we will not be realistic and assert our positions and our expectations. Constitutionally the door is open for everybody to contest for the position of governor, neither I nor the governor can foreclose what will happen or decide on the interest of others. The issue of zoning is the problem of political parties and not ours,” said.        
He also said that the zone had not been favoured in the appointment of a minister which is dominated by other senatorial zones.
In reaction to the position of the Edo South leaders, a group under the auspices of Akoko-Edo/Owan Credible Alliance For Better Representation declared support for the zoning of governorship tickets to Edo Central by all political parties in the interest of equity, fairness and social justice. The body believed that zoning the office would promote peace, unity and cohesion amongst the Bini, Esan and Afemai people.

Alluding to the above in a statement, the spokesman of the group, Comrade Rolland Igbadun faulted the Edo South leaders for backing the idea of throwing the ticket open to all zones. The group vowed to mobilize Edo North voters against any political party that fields Edo South candidates.
He said, “For fairness and social justice, Edo Central should have the ticket of all political parties in next year’s governorship election. They have been abandoned for too long and such practice won’t make room for developments. Chief Oyegun, Chief Lucky Igbinedion and other leaders who were at a meeting on Sunday should serve as role models to the younger generation instead of preaching politics of dominance.
“The peace and security we enjoy in the state should not be taken for granted. Edo people are not pushovers. They must not be allowed to succeed with their intentions of allowing power to remain in Edo South. Edo is for all. So, no one section or tribe should be allowed to hold on to power forever. It will only cause more crises for the state. That is what we don’t want. All parties must zone their tickets to Edo Central.
“Declaring that retiring the ticket to Edo South after Governor Godwin Obaseki’s two-term eight-year tenure will instigate bad blood amongst Edo citizens. This move will not sit well with Edo North voters because this might cause voters to rethink their loyalty and support to the leading parties. Let the right thing be done so that everyone will be seen being carried along,” Igbadun noted.
Also, a chieftain of the APC in Edo Central Senatorial, Major General Cecil Esekhaigbe (retd) said only unity of purpose and selflessness would enable the district to get the governorship ticket of his party and go ahead to win the election. The retired general and some other leaders in the zone recently attempted to prune the number of aspirants but the move generated a backlash from aspirants who lost out.      
Esekhaigbe said other senatorial zones were ganging up against them by discarding zoning and harping on capacity and competence, which he said was an attempt to undermine them. He noted that despite his genuine intentions for his party and the people of Esanland, he had been called unpalatable names.
Referring to some of the aspirants who willingly participated in the screening and suddenly turned against him, he said, “Why will a man deny he was not invited for an exercise which he deliberately skipped? “Why will a man who knows his constitutional limitations of tenure continue to deceive himself? Is Esan looking for a one-term Governor?
“Can a man who is still on active service of a corporate organisation come and take precedence over the men who have kept the party for years? Some known political scammers have assured them of the Daman miracle.
“Some Esan political leaders are deliberately sowing seeds of discord to the advantage of the other senatorial districts. Some are even positioning for deputy governorship. Let us have a conversation today about our best for the job. Tomorrow may be too late. Those calling me names today would remember this day tomorrow. Take the message and forget the messenger. We need only one man for the job. Edo Central needs the APC ticket, and so do other parties in Esanland. I repeat with emphasis that all the aspirants cannot get the ticket. Only one aspirant will get the ticket,” he added.

In a new call, the Esan Okpa, in a statement on Monday by Egbadon and Iyare, restated the need for all political parties to pick their candidates from the Edo Central senatorial zone, to correct the prevailing political imbalance in the state to guarantee justice, equity, fairness and peace to all segments of the state.
Arguing that it would be a “grave mistake to do otherwise”, the group canvassed for realism anchored on history and mutual respect to the different sections of the state, in casting lot for the next governor of the state that would succeed Obaseki, whose term expires on November 12, 2024. The group also stressed the need for the parties, political elite and opinion molders in the state to appreciate this salient concern by the Esan people and be mindful that the state was founded on a tripod of brotherhood at its creation in 1991.
Restating its strong appeal to political elites from Edo North and South senatorial zones to concede the governorship ticket to aspirants from Edo Central senatorial zone, it maintains that this is a recipe for ensuring peace, equity, justice and even development to all sections of the state.  
“On our part, we have worked strenuously to reach out to our brothers and sisters in the other two zones to demonstrate our resolve on this matter. Until now when we have started hearing equivocations by some opinion molders in Edo South and Edo North, we thought we had built a consensus on the just and equitable demand of Edo Central on this matter. We remain ever committed to continue to dialogue with all political strands of the state to achieve this goal” it says.
The group noted that since the creation of the state 32 years ago, only one governor of Esan extraction, Prof Oserheimen Osunbor, who was in the saddle for just 18 months, while Edo South senatorial zone would have had a combined reign of 17 and a half years between Governors John Oyegun, Lucky Igbinedion and Godwin Obaseki, who will be rounding up his two-term tenure this year. The group said that Edo North senatorial zone through the reign of Governor Adams Oshiomhole was also in the saddle for 8 years. They have also produced the deputy governor in turn, during this period.
Arguing that political leaders in Edo State cannot now wear blinkers and play Janus in this matter, Esan Okpa stated, “At national politics, we are loud in supporting zoning as a way of guaranteeing justice, equity and fairness to all sections of the country and then recoil to opportunistically discard this at home. Enough of this equivocation.’’
It is clear the quest for power and the winner-takes-it-all-syndrome in Nigerian politics have become a major factor in this debate. However, for Edo Central to realise its ambition of producing the next governor of the state, it needs to work more closely with other groups and negotiate how positions would be distributed, now that the parties have thrown their tickets open.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/11143007/Godwin-Obaseki.jpeg
politics,"I'm not fighting South East govs, says Deputy Speaker","The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu, has dismissed a media report of a possible rift between him and Governors of the South East States of Abia, Enugu, Anambra, Imo and...",1st January 2024,https://punchng.com/im-not-fighting-south-east-govs-says-deputy-speaker/,Dirisu Yakubu,"The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu, has dismissed a media report of a possible rift between him and Governors of the South East States of Abia, Enugu, Anambra, Imo and Ebonyi over the Peace in South East Project unveiled in Bende, last week.
A national daily (not The PUNCH) had reported on Sunday that the launch of PISE-P, a brainchild of Kalu, may have placed him on a warpath with the Governors and the Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide.
Reacting to the said publication in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary Levinus Nwabughiogu on Sunday, the lawmaker representing Bende Federal Constituency, Abia State, described the report as a sponsored attempt to dent his image.
The statement read in part, “It is rather unfortunate that in a move that smacks of lack of patriotism and support for the pursuit of peace and tranquility of a region hitherto enmeshed in violence, a plethora of sponsored gibberish are coming up both on conventional news platforms and online medium, all aimed at casting aspersions on the person and the office of the Deputy Speaker for championing a worthy cause. 
“In quick succession to the event, a national newspaper on Sunday, December 31, 2023 went on a wild goose chase, perhaps, on envy spree, publishing a heresy, more of a distillation of garbage called news, saying that the launch of PISE-P has put the Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu, the Governors of the five eastern states and the Ohaneze Ndi Igbo worldwide on a warpath.  Related News  Only peace deal can secure Kanu’s release, Kalu tells IPOB  Stop using Kanu's name for political interest, IPOB tells Kalu  Talks in progress to ensure Nnamdi Kanu's release - Deputy Speaker   
“It also said that Kalu is on a chase with Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State over who controls the south east politics in the ruling All Progressives Congress.
“This is to say the least, a hogwash, fabrication of lies that passes for tales by moonlight. At best, it is the figment of the overheated imagination of the author of the report.”      
The statement stressed that “As a true son of Igbo land, Kalu is very much concerned and greatly distressed by the security challenges that had bedeviled the south eastern geopolitical hemisphere of the country for a while now,” adding that
“What is expected of any son of the soil and the occupant of an office such as his, is to galvanize the people and deploy the influence of his office to find the panacea for the travails of the zone, and this is precisely what Kalu has done and still doing with PISE-P.”
While calling on the public to ignore the report, Mr Nwabughiogu noted that as a demonstration of support for the Kalu-led initiative, prominent Nigerians including.the Vice President, Kashim Shettima who represented President Bola Tinubu, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Abbas, Deputy Senate President Jubrin Barau, the five Governors of the Five South Eastern States, Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe, Ooni of Ife Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Emir of Bichi, Nasiru Ado Bayero as well as the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu graced the event.
The statement further noted that “Kalu is at home with Uzodinma, the reason he vigorously campaigned for his reelection in November, 2023. He is also at peace with all the South-Eastern Governors. PISE-P emphasizes peace. Peace among brothers and sisters. Peace for the development of South East. Peace for all.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/10204612/Benjamin-Kalu.jpeg
